The good news is that the results against omicron were much better among people who‚Äôd gotten a booster in the form of a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. In that case, the vaccine‚Äôs ability to block the coronavirus was essentially restored.

These lab findings will mean a rush by governments to offer booster doses. If omicron spreads widely, governments and companies will also have to decide whether to update messenger RNA vaccines like Pfizer‚Äôs to take aim at the variant.

Psychotherapists in the UK are pioneering a new approach to mental-health care in which the language used in therapy sessions is analyzed by an artificial intelligence. The idea is to use AI to identify which parts of a conversation between therapist and client‚Äîwhich types of utterance and exchange‚Äîseem to be most effective at treating different disorders.

The aim is to give therapists better insight into what they do, helping experienced therapists maintain a high standard of care and helping trainees improve. Amid a global shortfall in care, an automated form of quality control could be essential in helping therapists meet demand. 

Ultimately, the approach may reveal exactly how psychotherapy works in the first place, something that clinicians and researchers are still largely in the dark about. A new understanding of therapy‚Äôs active ingredients could open the door to personalized mental-health care, allowing doctors to tailor psychiatric treatments to particular clients much as they do when prescribing drugs.

How Facebook and Google are paying millions of dollars to the operators of clickbait pages, funding global disinformation üëá

The revelations from the Facebook Papers, a collection of internal documents provided to Congress and a consortium of news organizations by whistleblower Frances Haugen, have reaffirmed what civil society groups have been saying for years: Facebook‚Äôs algorithmic amplification of inflammatory content, combined with its failure to prioritize content moderation outside the US and Europe, has fueled the spread of hate speech and misinformation, dangerously destabilizing countries around the world.

But there‚Äôs a crucial piece missing from the story. Facebook isn‚Äôt just amplifying misinformation. The company is also funding it.

A @techreview investigation, based on expert interviews, data analyses, and documents that were not included in the Facebook Papers, has found that Facebook and Google are paying millions of ad dollars to bankroll clickbait actors, fueling the deterioration of information ecosystems around the world. 

Many of these actors would not even exist without these payments from both platforms, and the way they‚Äôre poisoning public discourse is increasingly threatening the stability of societies around the world.

The last 20 months turned every dog into an amateur epidemiologist and statistician. Meanwhile, a group of bona fide epidemiologists and statisticians came to believe that pandemic problems might be more effectively solved by adopting the mindset of an engineer: that is, focusing on pragmatic problem-solving with an iterative, adaptive strategy to make things work.

In a recent essay, ‚ÄúAccounting for uncertainty during a pandemic,‚Äù the researchers reflect on their roles during a public health emergency and on how they could be better prepared for the next crisis.

In late January, Elon Musk tweeted that he planned to give $100 million to promising carbon removal technologies, stirring the hopes of researchers and entrepreneurs.

A few weeks later, Arin Crumley, a filmmaker who went on to develop electric skateboards, announced that a team was forming on Clubhouse, the audio app popular in Silicon Valley, to compete for a share of the Musk-funded XPrize.

A group of artists, designers, and engineers assembled there and discussed a variety of possible natural and technical means of sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. As the conversations continued and a core team coalesced, they formed a company, Pull To Refresh, and eventually settled on growing giant bladder kelp in the ocean.

So far, the venture‚Äôs main efforts include growing the seaweed in a tank and testing their control systems on a small fishing boat on a Northern California lake. But it‚Äôs already encouraging companies to ‚Äúget in touch‚Äù if they‚Äôre interested in purchasing tons of sequestered CO2, as a way to balance out their greenhouse-gas emissions.

There are 86 billion neurons in the human brain, each with thousands of connections, giving rise to hundreds of trillions of synapses. Synapses‚Äîthe connection points between neurons‚Äîstore memories. The overwhelming number of neurons and synapses in our brains makes finding the precise location of a specific memory a formidable scientific challenge. 

Figuring out how memories form may ultimately help us learn more about ourselves and keep our mental acuity intact. Memory helps shape our identities, and memory impairment may indicate a brain disorder. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease robs individuals of their memories by destroying synapses; addiction hijacks the brain‚Äôs learning and memory centers; and some mental health conditions, like depression, are associated with memory impairment.

In many ways, neuroscience has revealed the nature of memories, but it has also upended the very notion of what memories are. In this story, we answer five questions that speak to how much we‚Äôve learned and what mysteries remain. Click the link in our bio to read more.

The study, published by the Committee of 100, an association of prominent Chinese-American civic leaders, found that individuals of Chinese heritage were more likely than others to be charged under the Economic Espionage Act‚Äîand significantly less likely to be convicted. 

‚ÄúThe basic question that this study tries to answer is whether Asian-Americans are treated differently with respect to suspicions of espionage,‚Äù said the report‚Äôs author, Andrew C.

In 2019, Amazon Ring and local law enforcement agencies in Florida and Texas launched new pilot programs offering free doorbell cameras to hundreds of domestic violence survivors. 

There is a logic to these programs. After all, who would be more concerned about a potentially dangerous visitor at their door than someone who had just left an abusive partner? 

But some domestic violence experts are concerned that these initiatives inject a combination of potentially dangerous factors into the lives of those they are supposed to protect: law enforcement that doesn‚Äôt always listen to survivors; a technology company with a patchy record on privacy and transparency; and programs launched without much department oversight‚Äîor input from experts on domestic violence.

When the United Arab Emirates paid over $1.3 million for a powerful and stealthy iPhone hacking tool in 2016, the monarchy‚Äôs spies‚Äîand the American mercenary hackers they hired‚Äîput it to immediate use.

The tool exploited a flaw in Apple‚Äôs iMessage app to enable hackers to completely take over a victim‚Äôs iPhone. It was used against hundreds of targets in a vast campaign of surveillance and espionage whose victims included geopolitical rivals, dissidents, and human rights activists. 

Documents filed by the US Justice Department on Tuesday detail how the sale was facilitated by a group of American mercenaries working for Abu Dhabi, without legal permission from Washington to do so. But the case documents do not reveal who sold the powerful iPhone exploit to the Emiratis.

Exposure notification apps were developed at the start of the pandemic, as technologists raced to help slow the spread of covid. The most common system was developed jointly by Google and Apple, and dozens of apps around the world were built using it. The apps, which run on ordinary smartphones and rely on Bluetooth signals to operate, have weathered plenty of criticism over privacy worries and tech glitches. Many in the US have struggled with low numbers of downloads, while the UK recently had the opposite problem as people were deluged with alerts.

Now we‚Äôre looking back at how this technology rolled out, especially because it might offer lessons for the next phase of pandemic tech.

Nathan McGee was only four years old when he experienced the trauma that would eventually lead him to MDMA therapy almost four decades later. It‚Äôs still too painful to go into the details.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd never really felt happy, no matter what was going on in my life,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI always felt restless, always felt this underlying heaviness. Things just didn‚Äôt connect in my head. It was like someone had taken a cable and unplugged it, and I was trying to fit it back in.‚Äù

Eventually, Nathan heard about a study that was testing the use of MDMA to treat severe PTSD and managed to get into a phase 3 clinical trial.

MDMA is a synthetic psychoactive with a reputation as a party drug popular among clubbers‚Äîyou may know it as ecstasy, E, or molly. It causes the brain to release large amounts of the chemical serotonin, which causes a euphoric effect, but it‚Äôs also been found to reduce activity in the brain‚Äôs limbic system, which controls our emotional responses. This seems to help people with PTSD to revisit their traumatic experiences in therapy without being overwhelmed by strong emotions like fear, embarrassment, or sadness.

In May 2021, the trial‚Äôs results were published in Nature Medicine. They were breathtaking. Click the link in our bio to read our conversation with Nathan about what the experience of MDMA-assisted therapy was like.

Altos Labs, a new anti-aging startup, has ambitious goals to reverse the aging process, but the company isn't without support. Some people briefed by Altos Labs have been told that its investors include Jeff Bezos, the world‚Äôs richest person, who stepped down as CEO of Amazon in July and weeks later risked his life by jumping into a rocket capsule to reach outer space.

Bezos isn't the only billionaire who may be involved. Technology Review confirmed that Russian-born billionaire Yuri Milner and his wife, Julia, have invested. This is no surprise, as Altos Labs was born after a large group of scientists met at Milner's home to discuss how biotechnology might be used to make people younger.

Milner, who made a fortune on Facebook and Mail.ru, previously started the glitzy black-tie Breakthrough Prizes, $3 million awards given each year to outstanding physicists, biologists, and mathematicians. But Milner‚Äôs enthusiasm for science was taking a provocative and specific new direction. As the scientific sessions progressed, experts took the stage to describe radical attempts at ‚Äúrejuvenating‚Äù animals.

Altos is pursuing biological reprogramming technology, a way to rejuvenate cells in the lab that some scientists think could be extended to revitalize entire animal bodies, ultimately prolonging human life.

Alan Woodward lives out in the countryside, in rural southwest England. He jokes there are more four-legged than two-legged beings in the neighborhood. He‚Äôs a professor of computer science at the University of Surrey, and his work revolves heavily around cybersecurity, communications, and forensic computing. He needs good internet‚Äîand yet he‚Äôs never had much luck finding it.

Six weeks ago, however, his circumstances changed, thanks to Starlink. Woodward became a beta user of @spacex‚Äôs internet service, which uses a growing fleet of 1,600 satellites orbiting Earth to deliver internet access to people on the surface. As of the end of July, the company was reporting close to 90,000 users. ‚ÄúWithin the first few weeks, I became a real fanboy of Starlink,‚Äù says Woodward. 

But Starlink wasn‚Äôt designed just to hook up remote cybersecurity professors: SpaceX has made bigger claims than that. It hopes to bring high-speed satellite internet to many of the 3.7 billion people on this planet who currently have no internet connection at all. Click the link in our bio to read the full story.

Carmela Sidrauski wasn‚Äôt looking for a wonder drug. Testing thousands of molecules during high-speed automated experiments in the lab of Peter Walter at @ucsf, she plucked one of the compounds out of the reject column and moved it into the group that warranted further study. Something about its potency intrigued her.

That was in 2010; today the list of potential therapeutic applications for that molecule sounds almost too good to be true. Since Sidrauski‚Äôs decision to look closer, the molecule has restored memory formation in mice months after traumatic brain injuries and shown potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, and Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS). Oh, yeah‚Äîit also seems to reduce age-related cognitive decline and has imbued healthy animals‚Äîmice, at least‚Äîwith almost photographic memory.

Floods killed at least two dozen people as Hurricane Ida swept through New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania on the night of September 1. This devastation is on top of the 13 who died and the million who lost power when the storm hit Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama last weekend.

Extreme storms are now becoming more common as climate change makes rainfall more severe, and storms will get worse with further warming. There‚Äôs still a lot that cities need to figure out to prepare for the resulting threats, which can range from flash floods to storm surges. Adapting will take time and money‚Äîdecades in some cases, and hundreds of billions of dollars. But climate change and adaptation efforts are running at different speeds.

If you‚Äôve been worried by recent news stories about a strain of covid called ‚Äúdelta plus,‚Äù it may freak you out to hear that scientists expanded the delta family from four variants to 13. 

Please take a deep breath. Scientists would really like you to understand that there‚Äôs no evidence delta has learned any new tricks, and these new names are for helping keep track of covid‚Äôs evolution‚Äînot nine new reasons to panic. And many researchers are also really, really hoping you‚Äôll stop saying ‚Äúdelta plus.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe name ‚Äòdelta plus‚Äô is completely incorrect, because it gives the perception that this will cause more damage,‚Äù says Anderson Brito, a member of the Pango Lineage Designation Committee, which assigns scientific names like B.1.1.7 to new branches of the virus. ‚ÄúSo far, we have no evidence any of the mutations affect behavior compared to the original delta variant.‚Äù

It is often said that if the brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn‚Äôt. 

That view is pessimistic: philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists have made enormous strides in describing and explaining the brain‚Äôs workings. But there have been some false starts and dead ends along the way, and many debunked theories continue to linger in the popular imagination despite having no basis in reality.

Millions of solar panels have been installed in the last two decades‚Äîand since they typically last between 25 and 30 years, many will soon be ready for retirement and probably headed to a landfill. But new efforts to recycle these panels could reduce both the amount of waste and the new material that needs to be mined.

Only about 10% of panels in the US are recycled‚Äîit isn‚Äôt mandated by federal regulations, and recycling the devices is currently much more expensive than just discarding them. But the materials in solar panels coming offline each year could be worth an estimated $2 billion by 2050. New efforts, including one approach from a French startup called ROSI, are trying to recapture these valuable materials, especially silver and silicon, to make recycling the panels more financially viable.

Last week, Apple announced new technologies to detect child sexual abuse material on iPhones. Apple says the new detection tool, called NeuralHash, can identify images of child abuse stored on an iPhone without decrypting the image. It says it has implemented multiple checks to reduce the chance of errors before the images are passed onto the authorities. The tool will roll out in the US this year.

The controversial new features strike at the heart of concerns about privacy, surveillance, and tech-enabled crimes. Apple says these new features preserve privacy as they combat child abuse. For critics, though, the biggest question is not about what the technology might do today; it‚Äôs about what it could become tomorrow. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Climate change and urbanization make floods more frequent and their consequences more severe. And yet, a higher proportion of people are living in areas that experience them.

In a new study published in @nature_the_journal, researchers used satellite images to map over 900 flood events that occurred between 2000 and 2018, affecting between 255 million and 290 million people.

And while the global population grew by 18.6% from 2000 to 2015, the population in these areas outpaced that growth, increasing by 34.1% over the same period. That means between 58 million and 86 million more people were exposed to flooding in those places over the course of 15 years.

In the middle of the night on May 24, TikTok changed its voice. The ubiquitous woman‚Äôs voice that could read your video‚Äôs text out loud in a slightly stilted, robotic cadence was suddenly replaced by one with an almost smirky, upbeat tone. Many users started calling the new one the ‚ÄúUncanny Valley Girl‚Äù to express their displeasure.

When we think of women in computing, we often think about how, both literally and figuratively, they have been silenced more often than they‚Äôve been listened to. And it is still the case that when we hear a woman‚Äôs voice as part of a tech product, we might not know who she is, whether she is even real, and if so, whether she consented to have her voice used in that way. Many TikTok users assumed that the text-to-speech voice they heard on the app wasn‚Äôt a real person. But it was: it belonged to Canadian voice actor @bevstanding, and Standing had never given ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, permission to use it.

TikTok‚Äôs decision to use a woman‚Äôs voice without her permission is only one recent example of a problem that some mistakenly think we‚Äôve moved past. Click the link in our bio to read the full story.

In May, the longtime coronavirus researcher Ralph Baric found himself at the center of the swirling debate over gain-of-function research, in which scientists engineer new properties into existing viruses. And during a congressional hearing, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky implied that the National Institutes of Health had been funding such research at both the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Baric‚Äôs University of North Carolina lab, and that the two labs had been collaborating to make ‚Äúsuperviruses.‚Äù 

Baric released a statement clarifying that according to the NIH, the research in question did not qualify as gain-of-function, none of the SARS-like coronaviruses he‚Äôd used in the experiments were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (the original virus behind the covid pandemic), and his collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been minimal.

The Olympic games are set to begin this Friday in Tokyo‚Äîwhere covid-19 cases are rising, prompting the city to announce its fourth state of emergency since the start of the pandemic.

Nevertheless the International Olympic Committee is pressing on. At stake are billions of dollars in sunk costs‚ÄîTokyo‚Äôs Olympic stadium alone cost $1.4 billion‚Äîas well as billions more in potential revenue for the IOC, Japan, local organizers, and broadcasters. 

A global health crisis that is far from over, a staggering amount of money, and a government set on making its gamble pay off: the forces colliding in Tokyo are unprecedented. And even with strict new rules at the games, experts worry that covid-19 could worsen in Japan. Click the link in our bio to read about how the IOC is trying to ensure the games will be safe, and how Japan will continue to be impacted.

On November 2, 2020, a teenage girl posted a video to TikTok in which she peers gravely at the camera, the frame wobbling as she angles her phone at her face. A caption superimposed on her hoodie shares an ominous warning: If Joe Biden is elected president of the United States, ‚Äútrumpies‚Äù will commit mass murder of LGBT individuals and people of color. A second caption announces, ‚Äúthis really is ww3.‚Äù Around that time, dozens of other young people shared similar warnings across social media, and their posts drew hundreds of thousands of views, likes, and comments.

Clearly, the claims were false. Why, then, did so many members of Generation Z‚Äì‚Äìwho are presumably more digitally savvy than their predecessors‚Äîfall for such flagrant misinformation? 

It boils down to this observation of internet culture: young people are more likely to believe and pass on misinformation if they feel a sense of common identity with the person who shared it in the first place.

During the winter of 2020, more than 40% of Americans reported symptoms of anxiety or depression, double the rate of the previous year. That number dropped to 30% in June 2021 as vaccinations rose and covid-19 cases fell, but that still leaves nearly one in three Americans struggling with their mental health. In addition to diagnosable symptoms, plenty of people reported experiencing pandemic brain fog, including forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and general fuzziness. 

Clearly, life under covid has messed with our brains. Luckily, they were designed to bounce back. This story takes you through the way our brains reacted to the stress of the pandemic, and offers tips for giving your brain the best chance of recovering.

"I‚Äôve been locked up since 2003," writes an inmate at San Quentin State Prison in this opinion article in our newest magazine. "Back then Apple had barely launched iTunes, and I was still in awe of the so-called high-speed connection I‚Äôd paid Time Warner to install in my apartment. In all the years since then, I haven‚Äôt logged a single second of internet activity. My frames of reference for what it means to be online now come from network television and print media. 

"California recently promised to provide free computer tablets to all state prisoners by the end of 2021, allowing prisoners like me to email our loved ones through a highly restricted prison messaging service and download content like movies and books. It‚Äôs a great first step, but without more open and frequent internet access, there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôll ever truly keep pace with the changing world outside our prison walls."

A few lonely academics have been warning for years that solar power faces a fundamental challenge that could halt the industry‚Äôs breakneck growth. Simply put: the more solar you add to the grid, the less valuable it becomes.

The problem is that solar panels generate lots of electricity in the middle of sunny days, frequently more than what‚Äôs required, driving down prices‚Äîsometimes even into negative territory. While lower prices may sound great for consumers, it presents troubling implications for the world‚Äôs hopes of rapidly expanding solar capacity and meeting climate goals.

A new report finds that California, which produces one of the largest shares of solar power in the world, is already acutely experiencing this phenomenon, known as solar value deflation. Click the link in our bio to read more about how solar value deflation can put climate goals at risk.

In 2008, FBI agents had started trying to understand a cybercrime explosion that was targeting Americans and pulling in millions of dollars from victims. At that point, with at least $79 million stolen, it was by far the biggest cybercrime case the FBI had ever seen. Even today, there are few to match its scale.

The FBI, Russia and Ukraine agreed to join forces to catch the world's most successful hackers. 

But things didn't quite go to plan.

Watching from afar as loved ones disappear and a way of life is erased, trauma has set in for Uyghurs outside China. That has sparked a mental health crisis that leaders in the diaspora say is all too apparent. Many, though, are reticent to seek help, or even acknowledge the emotional pain of the past years, leaving the community‚Äôs needs both underassessed and unmet. 

But lately a small group of outspoken Uyghurs is trying to change that. Using social media, they‚Äôre starting conversations about grief and mental health and, through telehealth, connecting people across the country with volunteer therapists.

When the DAVINCI+ and VERITAS missions to Venus were given the green light by @nasa last week, the scientific community was stunned.

Two missions, however, blew everyone‚Äôs mind.

On June 3 a 24-hour vigil, hosted on Zoom and broadcast live on other platforms, was put together by Chinese activists to commemorate the Tiananmen Square Massacre, Beijing‚Äôs bloody clampdown on a student-led pro-democracy movement that took place on June 4, 1989.

The fact that it could take place wasn‚Äôt certain: organizers were worried that they‚Äôd see a repeat of last year, when Zoom, the Californian videoconferencing company, shut down three Tiananmen-related events including theirs after a request from the Chinese government. The company even temporarily suspended the accounts of the coordinators, despite the fact that all of them were located outside of mainland China and four of them were in the US.

How does candy get its colors? These photos by @christopherpaynephoto reveal bits of the process.

IFC Solutions in Linden, New Jersey, makes both natural and artificial food coloring in ‚Äúalmost any desired shade,‚Äù according to the company.

Navigating and servicing favelas like Rocinha, one of Brazil's largest, is not easy. These unplanned settlements are densely and turbulently arranged in a manner that defies traditional identification systems like street names and numbers. Without a detailed map of the favela, access to public services including electricity and clean drinking water have been severely limited. 

Today, the city of Rio de Janeiro and MIT‚Äôs Senseable City Lab are working together to digitally map the entirety of Rocinha for the first time.  Carrying 3D scanners through the narrow alleys and down the sloping hills, they are creating an accurate digital map of the favela. 

Much has been made of the dizzying growth of the world‚Äôs cities, but few people are aware of what most urban growth actually looks like. Most new urban fabric is informal‚Äîmore shantytowns than skyscrapers. How we choose to respond to favelas, shantytowns, and refugee camps over the next few years will define the political and cultural attitudes that determine their long-term future. It‚Äôs worth recalling, then, that most cities were born from informality.

California‚Äôs carbon offsets program was supposed to help combat climate change. Instead, it could be fueling the problem, due to systemic flaws in its rules and widespread gaming of its market.

The landmark program allows forest owners across the country to earn credits for taking care of their land in ways that store or absorb more carbon, such as reducing logging or thinning out smaller trees and brush to allow for increased overall growth. Each credit represents one metric ton of CO2. Landowners can sell the credits to major polluters in California, typically oil companies and other businesses that want to emit more carbon than otherwise allowed under state law. Each extra ton of carbon emitted by industry is balanced out by an extra ton stored in the forest, allowing net emissions to stay within a cap set by the state. 

But an analysis by CarbonPlan provided to MIT Technology Review and @ProPublica estimates the state‚Äôs program has generated between 20 million and 39 million credits that don‚Äôt achieve real climate benefits. They are, in effect, ghost credits that didn‚Äôt preserve additional carbon in forests but did allow polluters to emit far more CO2, equal to the annual emissions of 8.5 million cars at the high end.

The causes of long-haul covid are still mysterious. But autoimmunity now tops the list of possibilities. The evidence is growing that the likeliest culprits, at least in some patients, are armies of runaway autoantibodies. Autoantibodies are a type of immune protein that have gone rogue and started attacking the body‚Äôs own tissue; they‚Äôre known to show up after some severe infections. 

The levels, variety, and ubiquity of these autoantibodies that @yale immunologist Aaron Ring found in some covid-19 patients look like what doctors might see in people with chronic autoimmune diseases that often lead to a lifetime of pain and damage to organs including the brain. ‚ÄúWhat rocked my world was seeing covid patients with levels of autoreactivity commensurate with an autoimmune disease like lupus," says Ring.

At a conference in New Orleans in 2007, Jon Greiner, then the chief of police in Ogden, Utah, heard a presentation by the New York City Police Department about a sophisticated new data hub called a ‚Äúreal time crime center.‚Äù Reams of information rendered in red and green splotches, dotted lines, and tiny yellow icons appeared as overlays on an interactive map of New York City: Murders. Shootings. Road closures. 

In the early 1990s, the NYPD had pioneered a system called CompStat that aimed to discern patterns in crime data, since widely adopted by large police departments around the country. With the real time crime center, the idea was to go a step further: What if dispatchers could use the department‚Äôs vast trove of data to inform the police response to incidents as they occurred? 

In 2021, it might be simpler to ask what can‚Äôt be mapped. Law enforcement agencies today have access to powerful new engines of data processing and association. Police agencies in major cities are already using facial recognition to identify suspects‚Äîsometimes falsely‚Äîand deploying predictive policing to define patrol routes. Around the country, the expansion of police technology has followed a similar pattern, driven more by conversations between police agencies and their vendors than between police and the public they serve. The question is: where do we draw the line? And who gets to decide?

The last votes for one of the most closely watched unionization drives in modern history came in on Monday, March 29, and results could be announced shortly. Almost 6,000 workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, on whether to join the Retail Warehouse and Department Store Union.

The facility in Alabama is fairly new. It opened around this time last year, as part of a pandemic hiring spree that ultimately saw the e-commerce giant‚Äîwhich is already the country‚Äôs second-largest private employer, after Walmart‚Äîadd 400,000 new hires globally in 2020 alone.

Progress these days hinges on the interaction between larger incumbent companies and nimbler startups. The big, established companies focus more on improving efficiency and protecting their positions, while the smaller, fast-moving startups are more likely to provide the breakthrough inventions.

The problem is that over the past few decades the larger companies have, with the help of regulators, gotten better at edging out startups. The pandemic has in some ways worsened this trend. It is even harder for many cash-strapped young firms to survive. And that doesn‚Äôt portend well for innovation.

Women have always been particularly subject to abuse online. They‚Äôre attacked not simply because of what they say or do, but because of their gender. If they‚Äôre people of color or LGBTQ+, or have a public-facing job, it‚Äôs worse. The same sexist message runs through much of the vitriol: ‚ÄúStop speaking, or else.‚Äù

But a growing group of activists believe the time has come to reimagine online spaces in a way that centers women‚Äôs needs rather than treating them as an afterthought.

In order to truly end the pandemic, it will be essential to get vaccines to all parts of the world. The first part of that challenge involves boosting the supply and securing doses for all, but even if enough vaccines become ready, the next hurdles are storage and distribution.

Some vaccines are already able to handle more typical refrigerator temperatures. But mRNA vaccines, which have proved more effective and will be far easier to modify to fight new variants, have a shelf life of just a few hours once they‚Äôre out of very cold temperatures. To get around these problems, scientists and engineers are taking two different routes: changing parts of the cold chain, or changing the vaccines themselves.

A wild-animal trader who caught a strange new virus from a frozen pangolin. A lab worker studying bat viruses who slipped up and sniffed the air under her biosafety hood. A man who suddenly fell ill after collecting bat guano from a cave to use for fertilizer.

Were any of these scenarios what touched off the covid-19 pandemic?

That is the question facing a joint international research team appointed by China and the World Health Organization that is now searching for the source of covid-19. What the researchers know so far is that a coronavirus very similar to some found in horseshoe bats made the jump into humans, appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan by December 2019, and from there ignited the biggest health calamity of the 21st century.

We also know they haven‚Äôt found the critical detail: if it was in fact a virus with an origin in horseshoe bats, how did it make its way into humans from creatures living hundreds of miles away in remote caves?

In a forthcoming, 300-page report, it‚Äôs likely the research team will  forward a favored hypothesis: that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, reached humans from bats via ‚Äúan intermediate host species,‚Äù such as a wild animal sold as food in Wuhan‚Äôs markets.

That‚Äôs a reasonable theory: other bat coronaviruses have jumped to humans the same way. In fact, it was the origin of SARS in 2003. 

This time, though, the intermediate-host hypothesis has one big problem. More than a year after covid-19 began, no food animal has been identified as a reservoir for the pandemic virus. That‚Äôs despite efforts by China to test tens of thousands of animals, including pigs, goats, and geese, according to Liang Wannian, who leads the Chinese side of the research team. No one has found a ‚Äúdirect progenitor‚Äù of the virus, he says, and therefore the pandemic ‚Äúremains an unsolved mystery.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to read our guide to the WHO-China search for the origins of the coronavirus.

The search for life on other planets is a lot like cooking. (Bear with us for a second.) You can have all the ingredients in one place‚Äîwater, a warm climate and thick atmosphere, the proper nutrients, organic material, and a source of energy‚Äîbut if you don‚Äôt have any processes or conditions that can actually do something with those ingredients, you‚Äôve just got a bunch of raw materials going nowhere. 

So sometimes, life needs a spark of inspiration‚Äîor maybe several trillion of them. A new study suggests lightning may have been a key component in making phosphorus available for organisms to use when life on Earth first appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Phosphorus is essential for making DNA, RNA and the energy source of all known life.

For years, scientists have assumed that water on Mars disappeared into space when the planet‚Äôs atmosphere thinned out. Turns out, the water may not have gone up, up, and away. It might have actually gone in the opposite direction‚Äîunderground.

According to a new model developed by researchers at @caltechedu and published in Science today, between 30% and 99% of Mars‚Äôs ancient global water may still be found within the Martian crust. 

‚ÄúThis work is standing on the shoulders of work that has gone for decades,‚Äù says Eva L. Scheller, a planetary geologist at Caltech and the lead author of the new study. ‚ÄúAnd more observational evidence has been leading us more and more toward thinking about the loss of water on Mars in new ways.‚Äù

Current estimates suggest Mars may have had between 100 and 1,500 meters global equivalent layer (m GEL) of water on its surface. (m GEL refers to a layer of 1 meter of water that would cover an even surface of the planet‚ÄîScheller says 1,000 m GEL is equivalent to roughly half the water of the Atlantic Ocean.) Even the lower end of this estimate is still plenty of water that potential life could have used to make a home for itself. 

So learning how it disappeared is critical. If we know what happened, we could have a better understanding of what locations on Mars could have preserved evidence of any life that evolved during that time‚Äîand how current and future Mars missions could look for that evidence.

The latest wave of tech companies quitting Silicon Valley and California may have mistaken what makes it a center of innovation: its ability to capitalize on its luck.

There has always been an immense amount of debate over what accounts for the uniqueness of Silicon Valley. We hear grand claims of innovative culture or geographic advantages. But the reality is that serendipity played a huge role.

Look at the Valley‚Äôs roots. First, William Shockley decided to leave Bell Labs and start his new semiconductor company in Palo Alto because he wanted to be close to his aging mother. Then, a couple of years later, a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against American Telephone & Telegraph led to mandatory free licensing of the company‚Äôs integrated-circuit technology. This sparked the explosion in transistors and computers, and wave after wave of change.

Serendipity is particularly worth keeping in mind as high-profile companies head for the exits. Just last December, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Oracle announced they were relocating their headquarters to Texas, and Tesla gave signs it may follow suit. Their moves have touched off a new round of hand-wringing and speculation over whether the Valley has lost its mojo. But this is not the first time the question has been posed. There were times in the past when progress appeared to be lagging, only for it to roar back with some breakthrough that seemed to come entirely out of left field. Click the link in our bio to read our subscriber exclusive about why it‚Äôs a mistake to bet against Silicon Valley.

Back in the 1990s, Lee Hood, a technologist and immunologist famous for co-ÔøΩinventing the automated DNA sequencer, made a bold prediction. By 2016, he suggested, all Americans would carry a data card recording their personal genomes and medical histories in vast detail. Upon arriving at a hospital or doctor‚Äôs office, they would present it to a clinician, who could simply insert the card into a computer and ‚Äúinstantly know what he‚Äôs dealing with.‚Äù 

Twenty-five years later, Hood‚Äôs vision of precision health care based on personalized data still seems a long way off. Too bad, because we could really have used it in the covid-19 pandemic.  No one can explain with any certainty why seemingly similar individuals respond so differently to exactly the same pathogen. Why do some of us get a case of the sniffles, and others end up on a ventilator? How can the virus attack the lungs of one patient, the heart of another, and the nervous system of a third? Why are so-called long-haulers left with lingering problems, yet other people recover fully? Why do some never show symptoms at all?

It‚Äôs hard not to wonder whether we‚Äôd already have solved these mysteries if the first covid patients had arrived at the hospital with Hood‚Äôs medical cards full of health data. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôd be much further along than where we are right now,‚Äù he says. 

The dream of true precision medicine has been mired in the sluggish and recalcitrant health-care system, where patient data is often seen as more of a nuisance than a benefit. 
But Hood, who is 83, has never been one to dwell on what could have been. Known for his scientific ambition and impatience, he sees the pandemic as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the power of data to help us understand disease. He hopes it will reinvigorate his three-decade-long campaign for a transformation of health care.

In late January, tech mogul Peter Diamandis hosted an exclusive, indoor conference for a group of ultra-wealthy patrons in Los Angeles. As we reported, the get-together, where no masks were required, became a covid-19 superspreader event.

Four days later, as staff, speakers, and attendees began testing positive for the virus, an email went out to those who had taken part. It invited them to join an ‚Äúinformational webinar‚Äù featuring a doctor who had been at the event‚Äîan attempt to put their minds at ease.

The webinar on Jan. 30 featured Matt Cook, a trained anesthesiologist from the Bay Area who had started a medical practice using alternative therapies. A follow-up email sharing the URL to view a recording of the call was accompanied by an order form for products from Fountain Life, a company focused on longevity treatments, of which Diamandis is a cofounder and director.

Attendees were also told about a range of products that were claimed to either treat covid-19 or prevent it outright. What they were not told was that seven of the recommended products were also classified by the US Food and Drug Administration as ‚Äúcovid-19 fraudulent.‚Äù

The fraudulent cures included amniotic fluid, the liquid that surrounds a baby in utero and is rich in stem cells, and colloidal silver, a suspension of metal particles often touted as having antimicrobial effects, but which the FDA has said ‚Äúis not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition.‚Äù Cook recommended taking both of them as an inhaled mist using a nebulizer, an electric machine similar to an asthma inhaler.

He even had a suggestion to help deal with the emotional toll of having been exposed to covid at the event: he could ‚Äúmail ketamine lozenges‚Äù to attendees as part of a ‚Äúprotocol for resetting fight-or-flight status.‚Äù (Ketamine, an anesthetic often taken as a party drug, has also been used experimentally to treat depression.

"It just doesn‚Äôt seem that different to me from other kinds of quackery,‚Äù says Michelle Mello, a professor of law and medicine at Stanford University.

Joaquin Qui√±onero Candela got Facebook hooked on artificial intelligence. Now he can't fix its addiction to spreading misinformation. 

After the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, Qui√±onero, a director of artificial intelligence at the company, was asked to start a team with a directive that was a little vague: to examine the societal impact of the company‚Äôs algorithms. Qui√±onero was a natural pick for the job. He, as much as anybody, was the one responsible for Facebook‚Äôs position as an AI powerhouse. In his six years at Facebook, he‚Äôd created some of the first algorithms for targeting users with content precisely tailored to their interests, and then he‚Äôd diffused those algorithms across the company. Now his mandate would be to make them less harmful.

By the time thousands of rioters stormed the US Capitol in January, organized in part on Facebook and fueled by the lies about a stolen election that had fanned out across the platform, it was clear that Qui√±onero‚Äôs team had failed to make headway against misinformation and hate speech because it had never made those problems its main focus. 

The reason is simple. Everything the company does and chooses not to do flows from a single motivation: Zuckerberg‚Äôs relentless desire for growth. Qui√±onero  supercharged that growth. His team got pigeonholed into targeting AI bias, because preventing such bias helps the company avoid proposed regulation that might, if passed, hamper that growth. Facebook leadership has also repeatedly weakened or halted many initiatives meant to clean up misinformation on the platform because doing so would undermine that growth. 

In other words, Qui√±onero's work‚Äîwhatever its merits on the specific problem of tackling AI bias‚Äîis essentially irrelevant to fixing the bigger problems of misinformation, extremism, and political polarization. And it‚Äôs all of us who pay the price. Click the link in our bio to learn more about how Facebook is addicted to spreading misinformation.

They have many reasons for modifying their bodies, but transhumanists are united in their belief that technology can unlock a new way of being. Meet some of them through the lens of @david_vintiner. 

The impetus for these body modifications sometimes comes from an accident‚Äîa man called James Young replaced his lost arm with a robotic one that‚Äôs something of a high-tech Swiss army knife. Other transhumanists simply want to see what is possible: to play with perception, the senses, and their own skin and bone in ways that can seem performative, and are sometimes deliberately so. Moon Ribas, for example, dances as a way of interpreting the vibrations she feels when the signals from earthquakes and moonquakes, registering on far-off seismographs, are beamed into implants in her feet. She and Neil Harbisson, who cofounded the advocacy group Cyborg Foundation, both identify as artists rather than technology researchers.

But while many cyborg projects are better described as curios than practical breakthroughs, they are nonetheless difficult to ignore. Modern consumer technology has, after all, already changed us in many strange and fascinating ways. Many people walk around with implants that regulate their heartbeat or insulin levels. And many more stare into the mirror each morning and carefully apply a thin, wet film to the surface of their eye to improve their vision. We may not all end up like Harbisson, who has a light-sensitive antenna sticking out of his skull. But who‚Äôs to say that he and others aren‚Äôt simply the first examples of a more advanced form of our species?

Our list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year wouldn't be complete without tech that resulted from the global pandemic. If we‚Äôve learned anything from covid-19, it‚Äôs the extent to which our lives are enmeshed with those of the people around us. We interact constantly, spreading our germs and picking up theirs. That‚Äôs why exposure notifications‚Äîusing your phone to tell you if you‚Äôve crossed paths with an infected person‚Äîseemed so promising. But digital contact tracing hasn‚Äôt yielded the lifesaving results we needed. In fact, it barely made a dent.

Nobody building these systems thought they would be a silver bullet, but the struggle was a stark reminder of how technology can fail to solve a problem even when its creators have the best intentions. Progress, of course, is about looking ahead. But as contact tracing reminds us, it‚Äôs just as important to retrace our steps.

The covid pandemic forced the world to go remote. Getting that shift right has been especially critical in health care and education. Some places around the world have done a particularly good job at getting remote services in these two areas to work well for people.

@snapask, an online tutoring company, has more than 3.5 million users in nine Asian countries, and Byju‚Äôs, a learning app based in India, has seen the number of its users soar to nearly 70 million. Unfortunately, students in many other countries are still floundering with their online classes.

Meanwhile, telehealth efforts in Uganda and several other African countries have extended health care to millions during the pandemic. In a part of the world with a chronic lack of doctors, remote health care has been a life saver.

GPT-3's ability to mimic human-written text with uncanny realism seemed like a milestone on the road to true machine intelligence. Here‚Äôs an example of what it can do. 

First, here's the prompt a human provided it: ‚ÄúIn a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs how GPT-3 finished the story: ‚ÄúThey also were found to have perfectly coiffed hair, and wore what appeared to be Dior makeup.‚Äù 

‚ÄòWe were shocked to discover the unicorns,‚Äô said anthropologist Daniel St. Maurice. ‚ÄòThey were like nothing we had ever seen before. We had heard legends of the unicorns, but never thought they actually existed.‚Äô

When the scientists first arrived in the valley, the unicorns were surprised and startled by the presence of humans, but were also excited. The unicorns welcomed the researchers and explained that they had been waiting for them for a very long time.‚Äù

As you can see, GPT-3 is capable of producing complex sentences that read as though they could have been produced by a human. Machines that can use language in this way are important for several reasons. Language is crucial to making sense of the everyday world: humans use it to communicate, to share ideas and describe concepts. An AI that mastered language would acquire a better understanding of the world in the process. 

When people started to try GPT-3 for themselves last summer, thousands of examples of its versatility flooded social media. Debates were even sparked about whether GPT-3 was the first artificial general intelligence. It‚Äôs not. Despite the incredibly convincing passages of text it can churn out, GPT-3 doesn‚Äôt do anything really new. What it shows instead is that size can be everything. GPT-3‚Äôs abilities also make it hard to ignore AI‚Äôs growing problems. If you want to know the state of deep learning today, look at GPT-3. It is a microcosm of the best and worst in AI.

Human intelligence emerges from our combination of senses and language abilities. Maybe the same is true for artificial intelligence. ü§î

While AI has grown remarkably human-like‚Äîeven superhuman‚Äîat achieving a specific task, it still doesn‚Äôt capture the flexibility of the human brain. We can learn skills in one context and apply them to another. By contrast, though DeepMind‚Äôs game-playing algorithm AlphaGo can beat the world‚Äôs best Go masters, it can‚Äôt extend that strategy beyond the board. Deep-learning algorithms, in other words, are masters at picking up patterns, but they cannot understand and adapt to a changing world.

Researchers have many hypotheses about how this problem might be overcome, but one in particular has gained traction. Children learn about the world by sensing and talking about it. The combination seems key. As kids begin to associate words with sights, sounds, and other sensory information, they are able to describe more and more complicated phenomena and dynamics, tease apart what is causal from what reflects only correlation, and construct a sophisticated model of the world. That model then helps them navigate unfamiliar environments and put new knowledge and experiences in context.

AI systems, on the other hand, are built to do only one of these things at a time. Computer-vision and audio-recognition algorithms can sense things but cannot use language to describe them. A natural-ÔøΩlanguage model can manipulate words, but the words are detached from any sensory reality. If senses and language were combined to give an AI a more human-like way to gather and process new information, could it finally develop something like an understanding of the world?

Click the link in our bio to learn how arming AI with multiple senses could be the breakthrough that gives it more flexible intelligence, a big reason why we named it to this year's list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies.

More than ever, we rely on technologies that can determine our location or pinpoint an object‚Äôs position. Precision agriculture, drone delivery, logistics, ride-hailing, and air travel all depend on highly accurate position detection from space. Now a series of deployments and upgrades to satellites in orbit and systems down below are boosting their accuracy from several meters to a few centimeters.

That could mean your phone knows not only which street you‚Äôre walking or biking down, but what side of the street you‚Äôre on. Even now, a shift in the dirt about the size of the tip of a sharp pencil in landslide-prone regions in China can be spotted from more than 21,000 kilometers above. And someday, that kind of resolution could make it possible for self-driving cars or delivery robots to safely navigate streets and sidewalks.

Hydrogen made using electricity generated from wind or solar power could provide a clean and carbon-neutral source of energy. A kilogram of hydrogen has about three times as much energy as a comparable amount of diesel or gasoline. If it can be made cleanly and cheaply, it could be the key to cleaning up an array of tricky vital sectors. 

This so-called ‚Äúgreen‚Äù hydrogen is today about three times more expensive to produce than hydrogen derived from natural gas, but that‚Äôs half of what it cost 10 years ago. And as the cost of wind and solar power continues to drop, and economies of scale around green hydrogen production kick in, it could get a lot cheaper. If that happens, green hydrogen has the potential to become a core fuel for a decarbonized future.

A new type of battery could finally make electric cars as convenient and cheap as gas ones. 

For all the hype and hope around electric vehicles, they‚Äôre simply too expensive, their range is too limited, and charging them isn‚Äôt nearly as quick and convenient as refueling at the pump for many buyers.
Making electric cars more competitive with gas-powered ones will require a breakthrough battery that remedies those shortcomings. That, at least, is the argument of Jagdeep Singh, chief executive of QuantumScape, a Silicon Valley startup that claims to have developed just such a technology.

The company asserts it did so by solving a chemistry puzzle that has stumped researchers for nearly half a century: how to use lithium, the lightest metal on the periodic table, to boost the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery without posing a routine risk of fire or otherwise sacrificing performance.

VW was impressed enough to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in QuantumScape. The German auto giant also agreed to set up a joint venture with the company to mass-produce the batteries and says they‚Äôll be in its electric cars and trucks on the road by 2025.

Technology companies have proven to be poor stewards of our personal data. üò¨  Our information has been leaked, hacked, and sold and resold more times than most of us can count. Maybe the problem isn‚Äôt with us, but with the model of privacy to which we‚Äôve long adhered‚Äîone in which we, as individuals, are primarily responsible for managing and protecting our own privacy. So how can we change this?

Data trusts offer an alternative approach that some governments are starting to explore. A data trust is a legal entity that collects and manages people‚Äôs personal data for them. Though the structure and function of these trusts are still being defined, and many questions remain, data trusts are notable for offering a potential solution to long-standing problems in privacy and security.

We got very lucky. The two most effective vaccines against the coronavirus are based on messenger RNA, a technology that has been in the works for 20 years. So, when the covid-19 pandemic began in January 2020, scientists at several biotech companies were quick to turn to mRNA as a way to create potential vaccines. In late December, at a time when more than 1.5 million had died from covid-19 worldwide, the vaccines were approved in the US, marking the beginning of the end of the pandemic.

The new covid vaccines are based on a technology never before used in therapeutics, and it could transform medicine, leading to new vaccines against various infectious diseases, including malaria. And if this coronavirus keeps mutating, mRNA vaccines can be easily and quickly modified. Messenger RNA also holds great promise as the basis for cheap gene fixes to sickle-cell disease and HIV. Also in the works: using mRNA to help the body fight off cancers. Click the link in our bio to read how mRNA vaccines will continue to revolutionize medicine after the pandemic.

Trapped inside a long glass tube in a ground-floor lab at @harvard is a miniature copy of the stratosphere.

When we visited Frank Keutsch in the fall of 2019, he walked our reporter down to the lab, where the tube, wrapped in gray insulation, ran the length of a bench in the back corner. By filling it with the right combination of gases, at particular temperatures and pressures, Keutsch and his colleagues had simulated the conditions some 20 kilometers above Earth‚Äôs surface.

In testing how various chemicals react in this rarefied air, the team hoped to test a controversial scheme known as solar geoengineering, which aims to counter climate change by spraying tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect more of the sun‚Äôs heat back into space.

Whether the tube actually replicates the stratosphere is the big question‚Äìwhich is why the team wants to move its experiments out of their toy stratosphere and up into the real one. They hope to conduct a series of scientific balloon flights, the first of which could launch as soon as this summer. 

If those launches are approved‚Äîand that‚Äôs still a big if‚Äîthey will be the first geoengineering experiments in the stratosphere. 

The initial flight will simply evaluate whether the aircraft‚Äôs equipment and software work properly in the stratosphere. But in subsequent launches, the researchers hope to release small amounts of the sorts of particles that could scatter sunlight.

But before the balloons have even left the ground, they‚Äôre already drawing criticism.

Even Keutsch, the Harvard professor and the project‚Äôs principal investigator, never wants to see geoengineering deployed at full scale. ‚ÄúI seriously hope we‚Äôll never get in a situation where this actually has to be done, because I still think this is a very scary concept and something will go wrong.‚Äù

A leaked scientific report from Israel claims Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine is stopping nine out of 10 infections and the country could approach herd immunity by next month. 

The study, based on the health records of hundreds of thousands of Israelis, finds that the vaccine may sharply curtail transmission of the coronavirus. ‚ÄúHigh vaccine uptake can meaningfully stem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the pandemic as vaccination programs ramp up across the rest of the world,‚Äù according to the authors.

The findings are important because Israel is leading the world in vaccinating its population, turning the country into real-life laboratory to understand if vaccines can end the pandemic. So far Israel has fully vaccinated 32% of its population, all with the Pfizer vaccine, and now has the world‚Äôs highest per capita rate of vaccination against covid-19.

The draft report confirms that the vaccine is able to cut covid-19 illness and deaths by more than 93% and also provides the first large-scale evidence that the vaccine may prevent most covid-19 variants, including those that don‚Äôt cause symptoms.

When the government failed Texans, people on the internet stepped in. 

On Valentine‚Äôs Day, the state plunged into a polar vortex the likes of which hadn‚Äôt been seen since 1899. 

Freezing temperatures led to widespread power outages. Homes more used to the swampy heat were useless against the wind and cold, with pipes bursting and ceilings caving in. Where water, clothing, and food were being distributed, lines snaked around the block. Hundreds of people in Texas have been made homeless so far. At least 30 have died.

The official response was sluggish and inadequate. It took until Thursday for the federal government to step in and send generators, water, and blankets to affected areas, and local municipalities struggled to coordinate efforts to clear roads and restore access to water. 

But when the government failed, a pandemic-era series of events followed: people stepped in to fill the void. Volunteers on the internet scraped together resources with whatever Wi-Fi they could get. Within hours of the Texas storms, Google Docs, Venmo accounts, and GoFundMe pages emerged online to help victims.

This is Valerie. She‚Äôs 46 and has worked all her life‚Äîthree jobs currently‚Äîyet she has just $65 in her checking account. Her husband works full time at a metal fastener plant. Altogether, after health insurance premiums but before taxes, they make about $45,000 a year. 

The story of her working life is also the story of Bryan, in northwestern Ohio‚Äôs Williams County. The town is broken in some of the same ways that much of the rest of the country is broken. Understanding what broke Bryan is crucial to understanding how it might be fixed.

For decades, America‚Äôs political and business leaders acted as if places like Bryan didn‚Äôt matter. Palo Alto and Greenwich, Connecticut, did fine. These centers of high tech and financial services create vast wealth in the country‚Äôs so-called innovation economy. But hundreds of places like Bryan, both urban and rural, were allowed to erode economically and socially. The innovation economy has largely passed them by. 

Developing a cogent regional development policy is one of the most vital public policy challenges facing America. President Joe Biden campaigned in part on the promise of creating ‚Äútechnology hubs‚Äù in 50 forgotten cities. The diverging fates of places like Bryan and places like Palo Alto is clearly driving a loss of political faith, and that growing nihilism is threatening democracy itself. But it doesn't have to be like this. We can still turn it around.

We spoke to Bill Gates about his new book, ‚ÄúHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster,‚Äù in which he lays out what it will really take to eliminate the greenhouse-gas emissions driving climate change.

The Microsoft cofounder, who is now chair of the investment fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures, sticks to his past argument that we‚Äôll need numerous energy breakthroughs to have any hope of cleaning up all parts of the economy and the poorest parts of the world. The bulk of the book surveys the technologies needed to slash emissions in ‚Äúhard to solve‚Äù sectors like steel, cement, and agriculture.

We asked Gates about the key factors that could drive change for our environment, including lab-grown meats, our political progress, and carbon-removal technologies. Click the link in our bio to read the full interview.

Deepfake porn is ruining women‚Äôs lives. Now the law may finally ban it. 

While deepfakes have received enormous attention for their potential political dangers, the vast majority of them are used to target women. Sensity AI, a research company that has tracked online deepfake videos since December of 2018, has consistently found that between 90% and 95% of them are nonconsensual porn. About 90% of that is nonconsensual porn of women.

Targets of this abuse are not just celebrities and Instagram influencers but private individuals. Deepfake apps are fairly accessible, too. Some are created for seemingly harmless purposes like face-swapping. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big leap of the imagination to go from ‚ÄòI can put my face onto a star‚Äôs face in a clip from a film‚Äô to ‚ÄòI can put somebody else‚Äôs face on something pornographic,‚Äô‚Äù says Sophie Mortimer, who manages the UK nonprofit Revenge Porn Helpline.

There are a number of reasons why deepfake abuses fall through the cracks of existing law. It can be difficult for victims to share their experiences publicly. ‚ÄúSpeaking about this stuff opens the door for more abuse. Also, every time you do it, you have to relive the thing over again,‚Äù says Helen Mort, a poet and broadcaster who was the victim of a fake pornography campaign. When victims do come forward, lawmakers don‚Äôt always understand the scope of the issue, and little is done. Now, that may be changing. 

Vice President Kamala Harris has long been a champion of a federal ban on revenge porn, which could mobilize further support. With a Democrat majority Congress, our government may finally take action to ensure the safety and privacy of women in the US.

He started a covid-19 vaccine company. Then he hosted a superspreader event.

Peter Diamandis, founder of @xprize and co-founder of covid-19 vaccine developer @covaxxvaccine, held an indoor conference of businessmen that was more than just risky. It violated state and county public health orders.

On January 24, while Southern California‚Äôs ICU was at 0% capacity, a group of businessmen were on their way to a pandemic year rarity: an indoor, in-person, mostly unmasked business conference: Diamandis‚Äôs Abundance 360 Summit (A360). The event took place at the XPrize Foundation‚Äôs office in Culver City, though in the month prior, covid-19 had taken 5,000 lives in the Los Angeles area. 

In one of its darkest moments, California took action, issuing a temporary state-wide public health order that banned all gatherings until regional ICU capacities rose above 15%. Yet Diamandis, who has an MD from Harvard Medical School and science degrees from MIT, neglected CDC guidelines and California state law by holding an in-person event. An hour before a scheduled interview with MIT Technology Review, Diamandis published a blog post about the conference, stating it wasn‚Äôt really a conference at all, but rather a ‚Äúvirtual studio-broadcast production.‚Äù He also claimed to have consulted an audio-visual company to carry out the virtual production. But A360 did not apply for a filming permit, and Culver City does not currently offer them for indoor film shoots, due to the covid-19 risk. 
Predictably, this event turned into a superspreader event, resulting in at least 21 positive cases. (He‚Äôs not sure.) ‚ÄúSomeone is tracking,‚Äù he said.

Towards the end of @eileenguo‚Äôs interview with him, she asked what this screw-up reflected of his leadership of a covid-19 vaccine company and an organization giving away $7.5 million in prize money to solve the challenges of covid-19, including encouraging mask-wearing. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to take a minute to think about that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet me send you an email.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to read the full story on this superspreader event.

Chicago thinks Zocdoc, a popular online health-care scheduling company, can help solve its vaccine chaos. But though more people may get vaccines faster, the most vulnerable could still be left behind.

Before the pandemic, Zocdoc acted as a one-stop shop where patients could check out different doctors, compare medical providers, and make appointments. The company‚Äôs CEO, Oliver Kharraz, says the years spent bridging a fragmented health-care system unknowingly prepared it for taking on covid-19 vaccination appointments. After the idea was tested with the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, Zocdoc says, Chicago reached out about a partnership‚Äîand the system was up and running within a few weeks.

The new Zocdoc tool will be a ‚Äúgreat addition‚Äù to Chicago‚Äôs vaccine drive, says Eve Bloomgarden, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but it addresses only one of the issues with the rollout. After all, it‚Äôs still a version of the same first-come, first-served approach, which means it‚Äôs not solving the most critical problem: vaccines aren‚Äôt reaching the people who need them most. ‚ÄúThere should not be 90-year-olds sitting around wondering if anyone‚Äôs going to remember they exist and give them a vaccine,‚Äù she says.

If you‚Äôre on the job hunt, you might be hired based on your performance in computer games scored by AI. Before you start the process, there are a few things you should know. 

- More companies are using AI-based hiring tools to manage the flood of applications they receive‚Äìespecially now that there are more jobless workers in the US due to the pandemic. 

- Researchers have found that many AI hiring tools produce biased results. 

- That‚Äôs why AI companies like @pymetrics are trying to develop ‚Äúbias free‚Äù hiring software, featuring games that discern applicants‚Äô cognitive, social, and emotional attributes. Some vendors are also hiring auditors to check their systems for bias.

- But just because a tool was audited, that doesn‚Äôt mean the tool is free of any bias or that the company‚Äôs algorithm actually picks the most qualified candidates for any job.

On January 28, a physician at a hospital in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad received an SMS with the date and time for his first shot of a covid-19 vaccine. He‚Äôd been toiling away in the covid ward, where he‚Äôd watched many breathe their last since April, and the vaccine was the one thing he was looking forward to. 

But he wasn‚Äôt thrilled when he read the message: it wasn‚Äôt addressed to him. It was like receiving a winning ticket with someone else‚Äôs name on it.

India, which has had the second-highest number of covid-19 cases in the world, has launched one of Asia‚Äôs most ambitious vaccination drives, aiming to inoculate 300 million people by August. To make it happen, the government is using a vaccine management system called Co-WIN. It handles registrations, creates vaccination schedules, and informs the recipients through text messages. Evidently, the system has been malfunctioning‚Äìsending appointment times to the wrong people, or not sending messages at all. India‚Äôs difficulties aren‚Äôt unique‚Äîother countries are experiencing trouble distributing covid vaccines, including the US.

Today the United Arab Emirates successfully sent its Hope probe to Mars. The space program is only the fifth in the world to reach the Red Planet, and the first program from an Arab country to accomplish an interplanetary mission. 

Hope was sent to discover what transformed Mars from a wet, warm, potentially habitable world into a miserably dry and cold one. The probe  will study the planet‚Äôs atmosphere with three key instruments. A camera will snap pictures of the planet using a slew of filters that restrict different wavelengths, helping scientists learn more about the water and ice content in the atmosphere or the nature of dust storms closer to the ground.

Omran Sharaf, project manager for the mission, told us  why it made sense for the UAE to try for Mars rather than a high-tech demo in Earth‚Äôs orbit or even a mission to the moon. ‚ÄúAs a young nation, we need to catch up. When it comes to technology and science, the learning curve is not really linear‚Äîit‚Äôs very exponential. It becomes much more difficult to catch up in the future. And this is why we‚Äôve started to go with a Mars shot,‚Äù he says. Click the link in our bio to read the full story on the UAE‚Äôs Mars mission. Image from @uaespaceagency

While much of the world is engaged in a frantic scramble to get vaccinated against covid-19, there‚Äôs one group noticeably absent from the queues of people at vaccine clinics: children.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is still approved for use only in those aged 16 years or older, and the Moderna vaccine is only for adults. Both are now in trials for younger age groups, and results are expected by the summer. The Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are also due to start trials in children soon. But in a world where most vaccines are given to children under two, why is it that during a global pandemic, children are being left behind? And what does it mean for how the pandemic will unfold in adults? Click the link in our bio to read the full story. Image from @gettyimages

Is messenger RNA really a better vaccine? The answer seems to be a resounding yes.

On December 23, as part of a publicity push to encourage people to get vaccinated against covid-19, the University of Pennsylvania released footage of two researchers who developed the science behind the shots, Katalin Karik√≥ and Drew Weissman, getting their inoculations. The vaccines, icy concoctions of fatty spheres and genetic instructions, used a previously unproven technology based on messenger RNA and had been built and tested in under a year, thanks to discoveries the pair made starting 20 years earlier.

Weissman has been a physician and working scientist since 1987. ‚ÄúI always wanted to develop something that helps people,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen they stuck that needle in my arm, I said, ‚ÄòI think I‚Äôve finally done it.‚Äô‚Äù

Unlike traditional vaccines, which use live viruses, dead ones, or bits of the shells that viruses come cloaked in to train the body‚Äôs immune system, the new shots use messenger RNA‚Äîthe short-lived middleman molecule that, in our cells, conveys copies of genes to where they can guide the making of proteins.

In the near future, researchers believe, shots that deliver temporary instructions into cells could lead to vaccines against herpes and malaria, better flu vaccines, and, if the covid-19 germ keeps mutating, updated coronavirus vaccinations, too. But researchers also see a future well beyond vaccines. They think the technology will permit cheap gene fixes for cancer, sickle-cell disease, and maybe even HIV.

Getting vaccinated is hard. It‚Äôs even harder without the internet.

For as long as the internet has existed, there has been a divide between those who have it and those who do not, with high stakes for people stuck on the wrong side of America‚Äôs persistent digital divide. For years, the digital divide was seen as a largely rural problem, and billions of dollars have gone into expanding broadband infrastructure and funding telecom companies to reach into more remote, underserved areas. But this divide isn‚Äôt only about proximity to internet services‚Äìmany simply can‚Äôt afford it. 

Covid-19 has widened many internet inequities, including the ability to facilitate an appointment for the covid-19 vaccine, and the ‚Äúhomework gap‚Äù that threatened to leave lower-income students behind as schools moved online. Many complained to the FCC when a program to maintain internet accessibility wasn‚Äôt working as intended. Among them was a mother who explained that the pandemic was forcing her to make an impossible choice.

‚ÄúI have four boys who are all in school and need the internet to do their online school work,‚Äù she wrote. Her line was disconnected despite a promise that it would not be turned off due to non-payment. ‚ÄúI paid my bill of $221.00 to turn my services on. It was the last money I had and now do not have money to buy groceries for the week,‚Äù she wrote.

So you got the vaccine. Can you still infect people? 

Pfizer is offering extra coronavirus tests to some volunteers in Argentina and the US as part of a plan to help answer a key covid unknown‚Äîhow often vaccinated people develop asymptomatic coronavirus infections and whether they can still spread the virus, despite getting the shot.

The evidence so far suggests that vaccines should cut the chance of transmission, but may not eliminate it. Right now, nothing is certain. 

If you did get your shot, we‚Äôre thrilled for you, but *please* keep your mask on. Click the link in our bio to read the full story on what we know so far about vaccine transmission. Image from @gettyimages, edited by Ms. Tech.

We started with an innocent question: how do vaccines get to Americans? After a myriad of exchanges with the Department of Health and Human Services and others, we ended up piecing together a complete‚Äîand convoluted‚Äîpicture. 

Operation Warp Speed injected enormous sums into developing vaccines but left most of the planning‚Äîand cost‚Äîof administering them to states, which are now having to cope with the fallout. The reliance on chronically underfunded health departments has exposed a threadbare digital ecosystem in which manual data entry, unscalable though it is, is often the fastest way to fix things that break.

Compounding the problem, local leaders have repeatedly complained about inconsistent vaccine supplies. The lack of top-down coordination and communication has led to thousands of appointment cancellations and countless doses tossed in the trash.

‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed was an incredible effort to bring the vaccine to market quickly," and get it to all 50 states, says Hana Schank, the director of strategy for public interest technology at the think tank New America. ‚ÄúAll of that was done beautifully." But, she says, the program paid little attention to how the vaccines would actually get to people.

President Biden is already under immense public pressure to fix the country‚Äôs mangled vaccine rollout. His administration‚Äôs newly released pandemic strategy is organized around a central goal: to oversee administration of 100 million vaccines in 100 days. To do it, he'll have to fix the mess. Some critics have called his plan too ambitious; others have said it‚Äôs not ambitious enough. It‚Äôs guaranteed to be an uphill battle. But before we get to the solutions, we need to understand how the system operates at the moment‚Äîand which aspects of it should be ditched, replaced, or retained.

This brilliant tale of espionage and the space race tells the story (for the first time) of how a team of spies in Mexico got their hands on Russia's space secrets‚Äîand tried to change the course of the Cold War.

The year was 1959, and the space race was in full swing. The boastful Soviets were heading to Mexico City to show off their Luna satellite as part of a world tour. When the CIA learned about the tour stop, they saw an opportunity. 

Enter Eduardo Diaz Silveti. The Mexican spy says the CIA recruited him for a top-secret mission that was ‚Äútremendously necessary for the United States.‚Äù The CIA just needed several hours alone with the satellite to disassemble it, photograph it, scrape it for remnants of liquid fuel, and inspect its parts for factory markings that could give the Americans intelligence on Soviet operations. 

For weeks, Luna sat in Mexico‚Äôs National Auditorium. That gave Silveti plenty of time to pore over street maps, study routes, and scope out locations where he might spirit away the satellite and steal its secrets. Silveti and a team of Mexican and American spies chose the closing night of the exhibition as the night they would carry out the heist. 

They came up with a distraction at the Soviets‚Äô hotel. Attractive Mexican and American girls would lure the Soviet soldiers to a party, while Silveti would hijack the truck carrying the satellite back to the train station. On that evening in late December 1959, the heist began.

If they got things wrong, Silveti was warned by the CIA‚Äôs most revered spymaster in Latin America, ‚ÄúWorld War III could begin.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to discover how this audacious plan unfolded. Illustrations by @madiketch

An AI saw a cropped photo of @aoc. It autocompleted her wearing a bikini. 

Whatever harmful ideas are present on the internet, including the dark corners of Reddit and Twitter, are embedded into the AIs trained on them. Feed an image-generating algorithm a photo of a man cropped right below his neck, and 43% of the time it will autocomplete him wearing a suit. Feed the same algorithm a cropped photo of a woman, even a public figure like US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and 53% of the time it will autocomplete her wearing a low-cut top or bikini. That‚Äôs what researchers demonstrated for the first time when they looked at two algorithms that both use completely unsupervised learning: OpenAI‚Äôs iGPT and Google‚Äôs SimCLR. This has implications not just for image generation, but for all computer-vision applications, including video-based candidate assessment algorithms, facial recognition, and surveillance.

‚ÄúAg tech‚Äù startups are looking to transform one of the planet‚Äôs oldest occupations. Boosters have been promising a surge of gadgets and software that would remake the agriculture industry for at least 15 years. Now, they may finally be onto something. 

Technology‚Äôs race to disrupt farming centers on the effort to imitate, and ultimately outdo, the extraordinary powers of two human body parts. One is the hand, able to cut lettuce or pluck a ripe strawberry. The other is the eye, which is increasingly being challenged by cloud computing, digital imagery, and machine learning.

The term ‚Äúag tech‚Äù was coined at a conference in Salinas; ever since, boosters have been promising technology that would remake the farming industry. Many solutions have fallen short‚Äìa computer meant to detect healthy seedlings doesn‚Äôt run smoothly in hot agricultural fields. A Zamboni doing the work of a weeding crew gets stuck in the mud. Not only do these technologies create additional problems for farmers, they don‚Äôt add anything new. So the tech question farmers have is: ‚ÄúWhat are you telling us that we didn‚Äôt already know?‚Äù

What everyone wants, in a word, is foresight. The government has sheltered growers of corn, wheat and soybeans from the financial impact of pests and bad weather by offering subsidies; fruits and vegetables do not enjoy the same protection. The focus for ag tech boosters has now shifted towards yield predictions to prevent farmers from suffering major losses. ‚ÄúEveryone thinks farmers know how they grow, but the reality is they‚Äôre pulling it out of the air. They don‚Äôt track that down to the lot level,‚Äù says Aaron Magenheim, who runs a consultancy focused on farm technology.

A new wave of hip apps are baking the immediacy and rawness of audio into the core experience, making voice the way people connect again. From phone calls to messaging and back to audio‚Äîthe way we use our phones may be coming full circle. But voice-only spaces can quickly get ugly, just like anywhere else on the internet, and content moderation in audio is far more difficult than it is in text. There‚Äôs reason to believe these newer, less regulated platforms will be attractive to disaffected, far-right conspiracy-minded extremists and QAnon believers, who are now creating their own podcast networks. Despite content moderation worries, audio is moving furiously forward: Twitter Spaces is in beta, Clubhouse just announced it will pay creators, and Discord is growing exponentially, among others.

The rivalry between the US and China is the 21st-century's biggest space race. 

China is set to build a new space station later this year and will likely attempt to send its taikonauts to the moon before the decade ends. This year it sent a robot to Mars and brought back moon rocks to Earth for the first time in its history. But there were a few achievements the rest of the world might not have noticed. 

One was the November 7 launch of Ceres-1, a new type of rocket that, at just 62 feet in height, is capable of taking 770 pounds of payload into low Earth orbit. The launch sent the Tianqi 11 communications satellite into space.Ceres-1 wasn‚Äôt built and launched by China‚Äôs national program. It was a commercial rocket‚Äîonly the second from a Chinese company ever to go into space. And the launch happened less than three years after the company was founded. 

The achievement is a milestone for China‚Äôs fledgling‚Äîbut rapidly growing‚Äîprivate space industry, an increasingly critical part of the country‚Äôs quest to dethrone the US as the world‚Äôs preeminent space power. China‚Äôs private space business is less focused on prestige and glory. Rather, it is more concerned with reducing the cost of spaceflight, increasing China‚Äôs international influence‚Äîand making money. China has seen an opportunity. A 2017 report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that the space industry could be worth up to $2.7 trillion by 2030. 

Setting foot on the moon and establishing a lunar colony might be a statement of national power, but securing a share of such a highly lucrative business is perhaps even more important to the country‚Äôs future.

‚ÄúIn the future, there will be tens of thousands of satellites waiting to launch, which is a major opportunity for Galactic Energy‚Äù says Wu Yue, a company spokesperson.

The work of predicting how fires spread had long been a matter of hand-drawn ellipses and models so slow analysts set them before bed and hoped they were done in the morning. Now, they use tools that funnel data from dozens of distinct feeds: weather forecasts, satellite images, and measures of moisture in a given area.

But today‚Äôs fires are getting bigger and harder to predict. Getting ahead of them will require not simply new computational tools but a sweeping change in how forests are managed. The only way to tame them may be to remake the landscape itself. The goal is less to regenerate native forests in these areas than to work with the landscape to develop a new type of forest where wildfires are less likely to blow out into massive blazes. But in California, for instance, that might mean a new Sierra Nevada with open stands of ponderosa pine punctuated by fields of grass, picked over by goats or cattle.

At the moment, the most pressing issues on President Biden‚Äôs table are fighting the coronavirus pandemic, providing financial relief for Americans, and reversing a series of Trump-era policies on climate change, international relations, and immigration. Artificial intelligence, as expected, hasn‚Äôt yet made it to the top of list. But he has given several signals already about how his administration might think about and treat the technology. There may be something to glean from his early appointments to his cabinet and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).

Nearly a fifth of the world‚Äôs population doesn‚Äôt get enough protein, while people in richer countries take in far more than they need. People also tend to eat more meat as they get wealthier. That has big consequences for the environment. 

The US and Europe lead the world in meat consumption (for reference, only 50 grams or protein are required per person). China and Brazil‚Äôs economies have increased, along with their taste for flesh. An outlier, India hasn‚Äôt changed its protein consumption much, although the country has grown much wealthier. 

When it comes to considering greener alternatives, the biggest issue is that innovation ain‚Äôt cheap. Asking entire cultures to abandon meat isn‚Äôt realistic. But neither is our current pace of consumption. We‚Äôre going to have to trim from somewhere.

The US may face a rapidly closing window to bring a suspected extra-contagious variant of covid-19 under control. If the variant strain, first spotted in the United Kingdom, is as infectious as some suspect (British scientists estimate it‚Äôs 50% to 74% more transmissible) it could dominate US case numbers by March, send covid-19 deaths to unprecedented levels, and collide with the rollout of vaccines. 

More than 20 countries have now spotted the variant, including the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of January 11 there were 72 confirmed variant cases in 10 states. That‚Äôs a drop in the bucket given that the US is confirming over 200,000 cases of covid per day. Yet the variant is likely more widespread than it appears, is one of several variants that have been identified, and the US still lacks the ability to adequately monitor changes to the virus. 

Some scientific leaders say the US should now consider a coordinated national lockdown period, and step up the pace of vaccinations. Some are comparing 2021 to last spring‚Äîthat is, we are facing a short window to clamp down on the variant before it, too, spirals out of control.

‚ÄúI think the conversation is going to shift if and when this variant gets a greater hold. It could be a game-changer,‚Äù says Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford to do the same thing when our enemy is adapting, changing tactics, and becoming more transmissible. We have to have those conversations immediately, because our enemy is getting better and we are not.‚Äù

Just as well-known, easily identifiable far-right figures livestreamed themselves invading the Capitol in Washington, DC, a lie started spreading around the Trump-supporting internet: What if the mob was actually a group of antifa activists trying to make the president‚Äôs supporters look bad? The rumor was false, and debunked repeatedly‚Äînot least by the words and actions of the MAGA personalities who were leading the charge in front of a live audience.

The lie had been seeded already, since false claims about antifa are peppered through the history of far-right online spaces. A typical conspiracy theory features an unfounded warning that buses loaded with protesters are being sent to cause trouble in small towns. President 

Trump himself has repeatedly promoted such claims, helping to turn anti-fascist protesters into go-to villains for his supporters. 

That gave fuel to the latest rumor, false though it was. It rapidly made its way through social networks, broadcast news, and online media‚Äîand was amplified and supported by some Republican politicians.

According to data from media intelligence firm Zignal labs, at least 411,099 mentions of the lie appeared online in less than 24 hours. The rumor morphed and gained traction as more people contributed subplots, and it swerved through niche platforms and into the mainstream, where a Republican member of Congress blamed antifa for the insurrection.

The mob who tried to block Congress from confirming Joe Biden‚Äôs presidential victory showed how the stupidity and danger of the far-right internet could come into the real world again, but this time it struck at the center of the US government. Neo-nazi streamers weren‚Äôt just inside the Capitol; they were putting on a show for audiences of tens of thousands of people who egged them on in the chats. The mob was having fun doing memes in the halls of American democracy as a woman‚Äîa Trump supporter whose social media history shows her devotion to QAnon‚Äîwas killed trying to break into congressional offices.

For weeks they had been planning their action in plain sight on the internet‚Äîbut they have been showing you who they are for years.

Can technology similar to the one that‚Äôs creating lab-grown meat produce breast milk that closely resembles the real thing? That‚Äôs the question Leila Strickland asked herself when she watched a Dutch professor unveil the first lab-grown hamburger in 2013. Like many mothers, Strickland found breastfeeding difficult and painful. As she watched the professor from her kitchen table, Strickland began thinking about how she might be able to use a process like this to grow not artificial beef, but the cells that produce breast milk. "A pregnant woman could have a needle biopsy of her breast during pregnancy, and I could get the cells growing and producing milk before the baby is born,‚Äù Strickland wrote excitedly in an email to a friend at the time.

This was the inspiration for @biomilq, the company she co-founded with her partner Michelle Egger. In May, the startup got $3.5 million from a group of investors led by Bill Gates. 

Biomilq is now racing against competitors in Singapore and New York to shake up the world of infant nutrition in a way not seen since the birth of the now $42 billion formula industry. 
That‚Äôs particularly important because doctors widely agree that breast milk provides the best nutrition for infants, but many parents must rely on formula to feed their newborns.

On Wednesday, at 7:02 p.m. ET, Twitter locked President Trump's account for at least 12 hours. Current and former insiders at Twitter we spoke with in the hours afterwards say the company needs to go further. 

Yes, Twitter‚Äôs latest move is an escalation of its running conflict with the president over 2020 as he spread conspiracy theories about the election and covid-19. But Twitter does not fully suspend the president‚Äôs account, or block him permanently from the platform. Facebook (and its photo-sharing site Instagram) did, "at least" until Trump's term is over. So did Snapchat. YouTube on Thursday implemented a stricter fraud information policy. 

As a world leader, Trump has benefited from policies that provide exceptions to normal enforcement measures, due to the inherent newsworthiness or public interest of his messages. But experts‚Äîincluding current and former Twitter insiders‚Äîsay that the events at the #USCapitol should be more than enough evidence to demonstrate why labels and individual takedowns no longer go far enough. 

‚ÄúIn my conversations with folks at Twitter, it‚Äôs clear that they should have seen this coming all along,‚Äù says Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia who has advised Twitter on addressing hate speech and harassment since 2009. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been communicating that. But now it‚Äôs clear that enough is enough.‚Äù

Twitter has largely viewed Trump‚Äôs tweets in isolation, Citron said, taking each potentially rule-breaking tweet as it comes. But instead, Twitter‚Äôs policy should be applied in a way that takes his behavior on and off of Twitter as a whole, she said. 

‚ÄúWhat he says in the debate is compounded with what he tweets to what he says to the crowd,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe incited violence. He did it through a course of weeks.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs causing death and destruction with his lies,‚Äù says Citron. ‚ÄúThe public‚Äôs interest is to take him off.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to learn what else insiders say Twitter needs to do.

This was a year we needed technology to save us. A pandemic raced over the land, there were wildfires, uneasy political divisions, and we gasped in the miasma of social media. In 2020, the ways in which technology can help or hurt never seemed clearer.

In the success column we have covid-19 vaccines. But this post and the article it links to are not about successes. Instead, this is our annual list of the worst technology flops and failures. Our tally for 2020 includes billion-dollar digital business plans that faceplanted, covid tests that bombed, and the unforeseen consequences of wrapping the planet in cheap satellites.

A spacesuit is more like a miniature spacecraft you wear around your body than an item of clothing. It‚Äôs pressurized, it‚Äôs decked out with life support systems, and it‚Äôs likely to look pretty cool. But should the suit fail, you‚Äôre toast. 

No one has ever died because of a faulty spacesuit, but that doesn‚Äôt mean current models are perfect. Whether it‚Äôs for launch into space or reentry back to Earth, or for an extravehicular activity (EVA, colloquially known as a spacewalk), astronauts have never been completely satisfied with the gear they are forced to put on for missions. 

Fortunately, though, the flurry of new activity in space has meant we‚Äôre seeing more innovation in spacesuit design and performance than ever before. The suits look better, too.

Your first-lab grown burger is coming‚Äîand it'll be "blended" with plant-based meat substitutes.

In terms of industry buzz, cultured meat has never been hotter. At the end of 2016 there were just four firms working on it. By early 2020, that number had jumped to more than 50 startups around the world trying to re-create at least 15 different types of animal flesh, including pork, shrimp, chicken, duck, lamb, even foie gras‚Äîall without killing a living creature. 

But the product is still exorbitantly expensive compared with old-ÔøΩfashioned meat, you can‚Äôt yet buy it at the supermarket, and for the most part it doesn‚Äôt look or taste much like the real thing. At least not on its own. 

While lab-grown meat was busy trying to find its way out of the petri dish, plant-based meat substitutes were undergoing a revolution. Firms such as Impossible and Beyond Meat broke through to the mainstream by cleverly mimicking the flavor and texture of ground beef, pork, and chicken using vegetable proteins and fats. These days you can pick up an Impossible Whopper at Burger King and Beyond Meat sausages in supermarkets in dozens of countries.

That kind of competition could be seen as bad news for cultured-meat startups. But a number of other entrepreneurs think it‚Äôs the opening they need to finally bring their creations to market‚Äîin the form of ‚Äúblended meat,‚Äù melding the best of the plant-based and cultured-meat substitutes. Even the world‚Äôs biggest fast-food firms are interested: KFC has announced it will be working to produce blended chicken nuggets that could be available this year. 

Regardless of who gets there first, blended meat is coming, and it might not be long before you get a chance to taste it. Click the link in our bio to read this subscriber exclusive.

The world‚Äôs farmers produce more than enough to feed the world, and yet hunger around the globe is getting worse, not better. 

Last year, according to the UN, 688 million people went hungry on a regular basis, up from 628.9 million in 2014. 688 million undernourished people seems like an abstract statistic, but each one of these millions is an actual mouth to feed, and the hardships they undergo are very real. 

In his 2019 book Food or War, the Australian journalist and author Julian Cribb describes the physical process of starvation in excruciating detail. The body, he explains, devours itself in the hunt for sustenance, depleting energy levels and producing side effects like anemia, fluid build-up, and chronic diarrhea. ‚ÄúIn short, starvation is one of the most agonizing ways to die, both physically and mentally‚Äîfar worse, indeed, than most tortures invented by cruel people, because it takes so long and involves the destruction of virtually every system in the human body.‚Äù

Today, Oxfam identifies 10 ‚Äúextreme hunger hot spots‚Äù worldwide where millions of people face this abominable torture. Some are theaters of conflict‚Äîincluding Afghanistan and Yemen. 

But even in high-functioning industrialized countries, the threat of hunger‚Äînot just poor nutrition, but actual hunger‚Äîhas been rising as a result of economic inequality. In the UK, the use of food banks has more than doubled since 2013. In the US, food insecurity is widespread, and the hardest hit are children, elders, and the poor. In Mississippi, the country‚Äôs hungriest state, one child in four is unable to consistently get enough to eat. 

So are there any answers? Can starvation ever be ended? Can we head off the approaching food and water wars? Click the link in our bio to read this subscriber exclusive. Not a subscriber yet?

As long as humans have built machines, we‚Äôve feared the day they could destroy us. Stephen Hawking famously warned that artificial intelligence could spell an end to civilization. But to many AI researchers, these conversations feel unmoored. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt fear AI running amok‚Äîit‚Äôs that they see it already happening, just not in the ways most people would expect. 

AI is now screening job candidates, diagnosing disease, and identifying criminal suspects. But instead of making these decisions more efficient or fair, it‚Äôs often perpetuating the biases of the humans on whose decisions it was trained. 

William Isaac is a senior research scientist on the ethics and society team at DeepMind, an AI startup that Google acquired in 2014. He also cochairs the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency conference‚Äîthe premier annual gathering of AI experts, social scientists, and lawyers working in this area.

Algorithms now decide credit scores, which children enter foster care, which patients receive medical care, which families get access to stable housing. Those of us with means can pass our lives unaware of any of this. But for low-income individuals, the rapid growth and adoption of automated decision-making systems has created a hidden web of interlocking traps. 

Fortunately, a growing group of lawyers are fighting back. Borrowing a playbook from the criminal defense world‚Äôs pushback against risk-assessment algorithms, civil lawyers are seeking to educate themselves on these systems, build a community, and develop litigation strategies. 

‚ÄúBasically every civil lawyer is starting to deal with this stuff, because all of our clients are in some way or another being touched by these systems,‚Äù says Michele Gilman, a clinical law professor at the University of Baltimore. ‚ÄúWe need to wake up, get training. If we want to be really good holistic lawyers, we need to be aware of that.‚Äù

In a year when thousands have died, people are using the virtual world to try to comprehend the scale of our loss during the pandemic. They're posting tweet-length obits for health-care workers. They're inviting people to remember those killed in incidents of police brutality by leaving a voice mail on their birthday. They're creating in-game memorials or characters in games like Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy XIV to honor lost loved ones.

Coronavirus patients often die alone, the usual rituals for observing death and processing grief demolished by social distancing protocols. As the pandemic and the rising casualty count dominated the news, people trying to avoid the virus have remained isolated at home, feeling helpless.

Death that is at once so prevalent and so distant is hard for us to comprehend. Our brains are working against us, researchers say: it‚Äôs one thing to know that four people were killed in a car crash, for example, or that a plane crash took the lives of 100-some passengers and crew. But with ‚Äúbig numbers,‚Äù our ability to comprehend and empathize starts to shut down.

The pre-2020 formula for dealing with death online meant memorializing the Facebook account of the deceased, maybe opening an online condolence book with a funeral home, perhaps a GoFundMe page to raise money for expenses. These newer online memorials are different, inviting strangers to peek into the lives of those who have died and participate in mourning their passing.

An AI has cracked one of biology‚Äôs grand challenges. DeepMind and the organizers of the long-running Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition announced that the AI, AlphaFold, can predict the shape of proteins to within the width of an atom, which will have a huge impact on science. 

In this year‚Äôs CASP, AlphaFold predicted the structure of dozens of proteins with a margin of error of just 1.6 angstroms‚Äîthat‚Äôs 0.16 nanometers, or atom-sized. This far outstrips all other computational methods and for the first time matches the accuracy of experimental techniques to map out the structure of proteins in the lab, such as cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystallography. These techniques are expensive and slow: it can take hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of trial and error for each protein. AlphaFold can find a protein‚Äôs shape in a few days. 

The breakthrough could help researchers design new drugs and understand diseases. In the longer term, predicting protein structure will also help design synthetic proteins, such as enzymes that digest waste or produce biofuels. Researchers are also exploring ways to introduce synthetic proteins that will increase crop yields and make plants more nutritious.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very substantial advance,‚Äù says Mohammed AlQuraishi, a systems biologist at Columbia University who has developed his own software for predicting protein structure. ‚ÄúIt's something I simply didn't expect to happen nearly this rapidly. It's shocking, in a way.‚Äù

In the mid-20th century virologist Jonas Salk coined the question-turned-maxim, ‚ÄúAre we being good ancestors?‚Äù You might know Salk for developing (and refusing to patent) the first effective vaccine against polio in 1955. Did you also know that he always kept the long-term view, evident in his aphorism, "Are we being good ancestors," he coined in a 1967 speech? 

Today, philosopher Roman Krznaric has renewed that question. ‚ÄúI had been writing books and lecturing and talking about empathy for many years,‚Äù says Krznaric, a self-proclaimed public philosopher. ‚ÄúBut what I hadn‚Äôt thought about so much is this: How do we step into the shoes, not just across the space, but through time‚Äîwith people in future generations?‚Äù

There are now two covid-19 vaccines reporting at least 90% effectiveness in early trials. 

With the virus having killed 1.3 million people globally‚Äîand more than 245,000 in the US‚Äîthese results from Moderna and Pfizer bring a glimmer of hope amid the gloom. Moderna says that it will be able to produce 20 million doses‚Äîearmarked for the US‚Äîby the end of the year. Pfizer is making 50 million doses available worldwide in the same time frame.

These quantities may sound big, but we will need many billions of doses before vaccines can beat back the virus on a global scale. Manufacturing and distributing these vaccines would be a vast undertaking at the best of times, let alone when the world‚Äôs economies and supply chains are already reeling from the pandemic. RNA vaccines need to be kept cold: Pfizer‚Äôs needs to be kept at -94 ¬∞F, though Moderna‚Äôs, which seems to be stable at -4 ¬∞F, can be kept up to a month in a normal fridge. Both vaccines also require two shots taken a few weeks apart to work. 

Given these obstacles, having two vaccines in the running and two companies ready to manufacture them makes the future look that much brighter.

This is DART. In a clean room in Building 23 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, this spacecraft was splayed open like a fractured, cubic egg. An instrument called a star tracker‚Äîwhich will, once DART is in deep space, ascertain which way is up‚Äîwas mounted to the core, along with batteries and a variety of other sensors. The avionics system, DART‚Äôs central computer, was prominently attached to square, precision-machined panels that will form the sides, once the spacecraft is folded up. Wires ran from the computer to the radiosystem that DART will use to communicate with Earth. Gyroscopes and antennas were exposed. In a room next door, an experimental thruster system called NEXT-C was waiting its turn. Great bundles of thick tendrils wrapped in silver insulation hung down from the spacecraft and ran along the floor to the control room, where they connected to a towering battery of testbed computers operated by four engineers.

A clock over one of the computers read, ‚ÄúDays to DART Launch: 350:08:33.‚Äù

DART‚Äîthe Double Asteroid Redirection Test‚Äîis designed to crash into an asteroid called Dimorphos. The impact will change Dimorphos‚Äôs speed by about one millimeter per second, or one five-hundredth of a mile per hour. Though Dimorphos is not about to collide with Earth, DART is intended to demonstrate the ability to deflect an asteroid like it that is headed our way, should one ever be discovered.

Since a Soviet probe called Luna 1 became the first spacecraft to escape Earth‚Äôs orbit on January 2, 1959, humanity has sent about 250 probes into the solar system. DART is unique among them. It is the first that sets out not to study the solar system, but to change it... by hurtling at a space rock at 15,000 miles per hour.

There have been increasing numbers of anecdotal reports of a link between surviving covid-19 and developing mental health problems in recent months. Now we have some numbers to back those reports up. A new study, published in Lancet Psychiatry, has found that almost one in five people who have had covid-19 go on to be diagnosed with a mental illness within three months of testing positive. Anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia were the most common diagnoses. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

On a seasonably warm day in August along a rugged stretch of the Southern California coast, work crews directed a fleet of heavy vehicles known as cask handlers to haul great white concrete barrels from the decommissioned San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, known as SONGS. Each cask, about 17 feet tall and weighing 50 tons, was like a set of Russian nesting dolls: entombed inside was a stainless steel canister, which in turn held 37 cylinders of nuclear fuel rods. 

Since 2013, when regulators finally decided to shut SONGS down for good, teams of scientists, engineers, and policymakers have been hard at work to make sure it could be safely decommissioned. A total of 123 canisters were taken out of the plant and moved to their new home. Their journey wasn‚Äôt long‚Äîjust to another area of the same site, about 100 feet away from the Pacific Ocean and just three feet above sea level. Now, with the spent fuel removed, the power plant itself can be dismantled. 

Shutting down was ‚Äúthe only logical decision in front of us,‚Äù says Doug Bauder, San Onofre‚Äôs chief nuclear officer. 

The US already has 83,000 metric tons of nuclear waste, enough to fill a football field about a dozen yards deep‚Äî and the leftovers will keep piling up.

That choice solved one problem, but not another: what to do with all the nuclear fuel that San Onofre had used. Its radioactive waste could outlast the human race, with spent fuel components that include ÔøΩplutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years, and iodine-129, with a half-life of 15.7 million years. But for now, there‚Äôs no place to store it permanently. 

So SONGS is keeping the rods of spent nuclear fuel in storage holes buried along the seismically active California coastline. They are sitting ducks for the next big earthquake, which is likely to hit within the next century. If the nuclear waste somehow got out, the results would be devastating. 

The plan is to eventually transport the fuel at San Onofre offsite, but where to? This is the story of finding homes for the nuclear waste that will (probably) outlive humanity‚Äîand the not-in-my-backyard problem that's standing in the way of a solution. Image from @spencerlowell_
Click the link in our bio to see all of our election coverage and to learn more about everything from secure voting systems and disinformation campaigns to the future of jobs and plans to combat climate change. 

Why are we, MIT Technology Review, covering the election? Elections are a technology. We don‚Äôt mean just that they rely on technology, although cybersecurity, voter data, misinformation, and online advertising are all central to how today‚Äôs elections are fought. We mean elections themselves are a technology‚Äîan essential mechanism in the running of a healthy society. Elections enable power to alternate between different factions without civil war; they limit mismanagement and corruption and tyranny; and they provide for a constant flow of new ideas about how best to run the country.

The central component of this technology, other than things like ballot boxes and voter rolls, is trust. If voters don‚Äôt trust the election, it fails at its only job, which is to produce a government that is widely accepted as legitimate. And most Americans, right now, do not trust the upcoming presidential election. 

All of our coverage has asked the same questions of the election that we ask of every technology: Is it working as intended? How are power and money shaping it? How is it being used and misused? What are its strong and weak points? Is it, ultimately, safe? We've used these questions to track the run-up to the election‚Äîand we'll use them to track the aftermath.

We spoke to election experts about what you should expect Tuesday. Mainly, you should expect uncertainty. When you see examples of issues with ballots or polling stations, try to understand them in a broader context: dramatic and often unverified anecdotes get amplified but are not the norm. And think twice about what anyone except for state and local election officials says about results, because candidates have their own needs to serve. This election in the time of a pandemic is fundamentally different from any that‚Äôs come before, and we have to understand that the results may come in differently, and later, as a result. ‚ÄúThere will be claims of voter fraud and claims that the election is rigged; it‚Äôs an inevitability,‚Äù Kate Starbird, a crisis informatics researcher at the University of Washington and one of the lead researchers at the Election Integrity Partnership, told us. ‚ÄúHow salient that is, how much people grab on, depends on results and margins of victory. But some of the worst scenarios are that a large portion of society feels they‚Äôve been cheated. That‚Äôs where you start to lose trust in democracy.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to educate yourself about what to expect on Election Day, this week, and as we wait for official results. #election2020 #electionday #uselection #uspolitics #technology #technologynews #technews #techreview #technologyreview #mittechnologyreview

Every so often, journalist Richard Fisher ask his daughter about the future. When she was three, she had only a basic concept of time, with little awareness of clocks or calendars. She could understand The Very Hungry Caterpillar, a classic children‚Äôs book about a creature gorging on food over a week, but when she would tell the story back to him, she would mix up the days. Time, for her, was disordered. By the age of five, however, she had figured out how yesterday trailed behind her and tomorrow extended in front. 

She‚Äôs now seven. The older she gets, the more she populates the years to come in her imagination. Culture fills much of that canvas, and he often has no idea where she picks it up. 

‚ÄúThe Singulation,‚Äù she explained to him recently, ‚Äúis where people are miserable in the future. And a person says ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô The robots take over the Earth.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWait, are you talking about the Singularity? Where did you learn that?!‚Äù

The cartoon Captain Underpants, she said.

Just as children expand their temporal perceptions as they age, so too has our species over millennia. Like toddlers, our pre-human ancestors had no sense of a distant future. Humanity‚Äôs trajectory from tool-wielding hominins to the architects of grand metropolises has been interwoven with our ever-expanding sense of time. Unlike other animals, we have minds capable of imagining a deep future, and we can conceive the daunting truth that our lifetime is a mere flash in an unfathomable chronology. 

Yet while we may have this ability, it is rarely deployed in daily life. If our descendants were to diagnose the ills of 21st-century civilization, they would observe a dangerous short-termism: a collective failure to escape the present moment and look further ahead. The world is saturated in information, and standards of living have never been higher, but so often it‚Äôs a struggle to see beyond the next news cycle, political term, or business quarter.

Often referred to in the West as Russia‚Äôs Google, Yandex is really more like Google, Amazon, Uber, and maybe a few other companies combined. But the tech giant‚Äôs success has come at a price.

The Kremlin has long viewed the internet as a battlefield in its escalating tensions with the West and has become increasingly concerned that a company like Yandex, with the heaps of data it has on Russian citizens, could one day fall into foreign hands. 

This means running a tech giant in Russia is a delicate dance. On the one hand is the Kremlin; on the other is New York, with investors‚Äô demands that the company maintain its independence. But in a pandemic-¬≠stricken world increasingly concerned with protecting borders and regulating the tech industry, Yandex‚Äôs dilemma may not be just a Russian story.

If you ever found yourself on Venus, you‚Äôd be destroyed in moments.

The US has approved wide emergency use of blood plasma from covid-19 survivors as a treatment for coronavirus infection, despite limited evidence it helps. It has been tried since early in the year in China, the Netherlands, and also in the US, where more than 70,000 patients have received it already as part of studies or under case-by-case medical exemptions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. However, some doctors have criticized how the treatment has been handled in the US. Because doctors have been allowed to give plasma to tens of thousands of patients outside of trials, they say, it‚Äôs been difficult to gather decisive evidence on the effects. 

The approval of the use of plasma also comes days after President Trump took to Twitter to accuse the FDA and the ‚Äúdeep state, or whoever‚Äù of slow-walking cures in order to interfere with his chances in the November general election.

The plasma approval could foreshadow US government actions around a vaccine for covid-19, some scientists fear. The chief doctor coordinating vaccine studies in the US has said data supporting a vaccine won‚Äôt be in hand until January at the earliest, but the Financial Times reported that the administration is looking to fast-track an emergency approval of a vaccine before Election Day.  If an unsafe or ineffective vaccine goes into wide use, that will be a bigger setback than we‚Äôll suffer if convalescent plasma proves a dud. That is because plasma is given to people who are already sick, while vaccines are given to healthy people. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Nearly 20 million people in the US use WeChat every day, many of them as a crucial lifeline to keep in touch with family and friends in China. It‚Äôs also used by businesses, journalists, and researchers. 

But twin executive orders President Trump issued this month could sever these millions of connections. 

The sorts of relationships facilitated by WeChat are ultimately the foundation of the US-China relationship: they are what allow both countries to keep an open dialogue and grow commerce and collaborations. Recovering those lines of communication would be hard: email is unreliable, and Zoom is also on shaky territory with Chinese users cut off from direct sales of the service.

Losing WeChat will ultimately harm the US‚Äôs ability to make smart decisions about China in the future, say researchers. And for millions of people, it will make it far harder to speak to their loved ones.

The thesis of our new magazine issue on what we've defined as technonationalism is that the post‚ÄìCold War order was already splintering‚Äîand covid-19 is finishing the job. In the last few decades, the received wisdom among global elites has been that technology tends to make the world flatter, smaller, more open, and more equal. This now seems increasingly false, or at least simplistic. Countries are vying for dominance in technologies that could give them a strategic advantage: communications, energy, AI, surveillance, agricultural tech, cybersecurity, military tech ‚Ä¶ and now, amidst a global pandemic, medicine and manufacturing. Technology, then, is changing the ways countries relate to one another and to their citizens. The stories in this issue explain how and why. Click the link in our bio to read them.

This is neuropsychiatry researcher Neguine Rezaii.

At the start of the week, Liam Porr had only heard of the artificial-intelligence model, GPT-3. By the end, the college student had used it to produce an entirely fake blog under a fake name. It was meant as a fun experiment. But then one of his posts reached the number-one spot on Hacker News. Few people noticed that his blog was completely AI-generated and not written by a human. Some even hit ‚ÄúSubscribe.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt was super easy, actually, which was the scary part," says Porr, who studies computer science at @ucberkeleyofficial. "‚ÄúFrom the time that I thought of the idea and got in contact with the PhD student to me actually creating the blog and the first blog going viral‚Äîit took maybe a couple of hours." 

For experts, this has long been the worry raised by such language-generating algorithms. Ever since OpenAI first announced GPT-2 (the precursor to GPT-3), people have speculated that it was vulnerable to abuse. In its own blog post, the lab focused on the AI tool‚Äôs potential to be weaponized as a mass producer of misinformation. Others have wondered whether it could be used to churn out spam posts full of relevant keywords to game Google. 

Porr says his experiment also shows a more mundane but still troubling alternative: people could use the tool to generate a lot of clickbait content. ‚ÄúIt's possible that there's gonna just be a flood of mediocre blog content because now the barrier to entry is so easy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think the value of online content is going to be reduced a lot.‚Äù

Facial recognition is being used as a search engine for criminals‚Äîand your face is the search time. But there's a big problem with this technology: it's much less accurate on people of color, women, and transgender people.

Russia has cleared a vaccine against covid-19 for emergency use on healthcare workers this fall. According to reports, doctors, nurses, and teachers will be given the shot first when enough supplies of the vaccine are ready in October, and it could reach the general public by January. However, Russia has not finished the larger type of study needed to prove it protects recipients against infection by the coronavirus, or is safe. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Researchers have demonstrated that they can make a face recognition system similar to those used at airports think someone else is you. This is the equivalent of tricking a machine into allowing someone to board a flight despite being on a no-fly list. üò¨

This is problematic because face recognition is rapidly proliferating as a way to identify people at airports and in other high security scenarios‚Äîbut it's clearly far from foolproof.

Right now, on Facebook pages, forums, blogs, YouTube channels, and subreddits across the internet, thousands of people are sharing their belief that they are being ‚Äúgangstalked.‚Äù These self-described ‚Äútargeted individuals‚Äù say they are being monitored, harassed, and stalked 24/7 by governments and other organizations. Targeted individuals claim that seemingly ordinary people are in fact trained operatives tasked with watching or harassing them‚Äîdelivery men, neighbors, colleagues, roommates, teachers, even dogs. Gangstalking communities are growing quickly; one estimate from 2016 suggested that there might be 10,000 people in such groups across the internet.

People who are convinced they are being gangstalked are mostly, if not exclusively, mentally ill. Their beliefs are delusional. Yet every day, the internet legitimizes these beliefs, discouraging people who hold them from getting professional help or taking medication, and pushing them further down the road of psychosis, with sometimes deadly results. 

Jenny‚Äôs suicide, and the story her ethical-hacker brother uncovered on her computer after her death, is a tragic reminder of how gangstalking forums can lead some seeking help down a dark path.

In Machines We Trust is a new podcast about artificial intelligence and what happens when everything gets automated. 

Some of the most important decisions in our lives are being made by AI, determining things like who gets into college, lands a job, receives social services, or goes to jail‚Äîoften without us having any clue. In season one of this new podcast from @technologyreview, we explore the powerful ways that AI is shaping modern life. Giving machines the ability to learn has unlocked a world filled with dazzling possibilities and dangers we‚Äôre only just beginning to understand. This world isn‚Äôt our future‚Äîit‚Äôs here. We‚Äôre already trusting AI and the people who wield it to do the right thing, whether we know it or not.

This is celebrity geneticist George Church. In his hand is a covid-19 nasal vaccine that one of his former graduate students at Harvard and one of his proteges, Presten Estep, developed in a borrowed laboratory somewhere in Boston. Yes, Church actually took the unproven vaccine, two doses a week apart earlier in July. The doses were dropped in his mailbox and he mixed the ingredients himself. 

Nearly 200 covid-19 vaccines are in development and some three dozen are at various stages of human testing. But this appears to be the first ‚Äúcitizen science‚Äù vaccine initiative. Church and Estep are two of at least 20 researchers, technologists, or science enthusiasts, many connected to Harvard and MIT, who have volunteered to be lab rats for this do-it-yourself inoculation against the coronavirus. They say it‚Äôs their only chance to become immune without waiting a year or more for a vaccine to be formally approved. ‚ÄúI think we are at much bigger risk from covid,‚Äù Church told us (he hasn't stepped outside his house in five months). 

But nobody knows if this is legal or if the vaccine even works. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Although NASA has teased for quite some time the idea of a pretty ambitious role for Japan in its Artemis program to send humans back to the moon, that talk finally became real on July 9, when the two countries signed a formal agreement regarding further collaboration in human exploration. It gives NASA a much-needed partner for Artemis‚Äîwithout which the agency would find it much more difficult to meet the long-term goals of establishing a sustainable permanent presence on the moon. But why Japan? The country provides a few major advantages, but the biggest might come from its strong auto industry. Click the link in our bio to learn more.

A covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe, and provoked a strong immune response in its first clinical trials. Antibody responses in participants peaked by day 28 and remained high until the last day of testing on day 56. A sub-group of 10 participants who received a second dose produced even stronger antibody responses. The vaccine also resulted in ‚Äúmarked increases‚Äù in T cell responses as early as day 7, and these were still present when researchers tested the participants again on the final day. Provoking a strong T cell response could be important: there is growing evidence it might be crucial to producing any form of lasting immunity to covid-19. Initial results for a second vaccine candidate, being developed by CanSino Biologics in Wuhan, China, were also reported in The Lancet on the same day, on Monday. While these results are promising, it‚Äôs still too early to know if either vaccine offers sufficient protection from infection‚Äîor how long any such protection might last. Further trials of the Oxford vaccine, involving more than 10,000 people, are already under way in the UK, while 30,000 people are being recruited in the US, plus 5,000 in Brazil and 2,000 in South Africa.

Immunity to covid-19 may be short-lived, according to a new longitudinal study of people who have caught the disease and recovered. In the study of 96 patients and health-care workers, researchers found that levels of coronavirus-fighting antibodies peaked about three weeks after symptoms started and then rapidly fell away. Only 17% had the same level of antibody potency at the end of the three-month testing period. Click the link in our bio to learn more about how covid-19 immunity could disappear in months.

A group of 239 scientists from 32 countries have written an open letter to the World Health Organization arguing that covid-19 can be transmitted through the air. You might think we know that already, but most current guidance is based on the idea that covid-19 is transmitted via droplets expelled from an infected person‚Äôs nose or mouth. The thought is that these larger respiratory droplets quickly fall to the floor. However, the signatories of the open letter say the WHO is underestimating the role of airborne transmission, where much smaller droplets (called aerosols) stay suspended in the air. These aerosols can travel farther than droplets and linger in an area even when an infected person has left. If covid-19 remains in the air, we need a different way of dealing with it.

What‚Äôs the matter with California and its spike in covid-19 cases? The nation‚Äôs most populous state was the first to enact statewide shelter-in-place rules, took decisive steps to build up the recommended testing and case tracing capacity, and has hammered the public health message on social distancing and masks. So what‚Äôs driving the outbreaks in a state that supposedly did things right? Why weren‚Äôt its ambitious testing and contact tracing programs adequate to prevent the recent surge in cases? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not one thing, but four or five,‚Äù says George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco, who is leading the university‚Äôs training program for the state‚Äôs contact tracing task force. ‚ÄúThe state is so big‚Äîthe population of California is larger than Canada‚Äîand there‚Äôs a lot of different things going on in different places.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to learn more.

In the United States, 75% of venture capital goes to software. Some 5 to 10% goes to biotech. The other sliver goes to everything else‚Äîtransportation, sanitation, health care. To put it another way, the funding model that made Silicon Valley a global hub excels at creating a certain kind of innovation. But the pandemic has exposed venture capital's broader failures for building the things we really need. Sure, when we have to (or want to) stay home, Zoom helps us work remotely, DoorDash keeps us fed, and Netflix gives us something to watch. But where was the cure, or the better protective gear, and why hadn‚Äôt venture capital‚Äîthe financial engine of innovation‚Äîfunded those ideas? Click the link in our bio to learn more.

This isn‚Äôt the first time bystander videos of police brutality have galvanized a movement. But this time they can be used to change policing for good. So how do we turn all this footage into something more permanent‚Äînot just protests and outrage, but concrete policing reform? The answer involves three phases: first, we must bear witness to these injustices; second, we must legislate at the local, state, and federal levels to dismantle systems that protect the police when they perpetrate such acts; and finally, we should organize community-based ‚Äúcopwatching‚Äù programs to hold local police departments accountable.

Lichfield and his bubblemates have all been pretty strict in their precautions up to now, but everyone does things a little differently, and he's commented to other friends that agreeing to bubble up (or is it bubble down?) with people is like negotiating an open relationship: What‚Äôs allowed? What isn‚Äôt? What do we need to communicate about? How do we resolve disagreements? Here are some suggested guidelines for how to have the conversation, based on nothing more than his own experience and that of his friends and colleagues.

The coronavirus pandemic has made clear a festering problem: the US and its dominant tech industry are no longer very good at coming up with new ideas and technologies relevant to our most basic needs.  Big tech doesn‚Äôt build anything. It‚Äôs not likely to give us vaccines or diagnostic tests. We don‚Äôt even seem to know how to make a cotton swab.

Many of you have asked us how long the coronavirus lives on surfaces. We now have an answer for you, thanks to researchers at the National Institutes of Health. In an experiment, they sprayed the virus on materials to see how long it remains infectious. According to the preprint, COVID-19 likes stainless steel and plastic the best and copper the least. So far, however, there is no definitive proof the virus is actually spread via inanimate objects.

Two weeks ago, Danielle Baskin had an idea for a tongue-in-cheek art project. Now, she‚Äôs suddenly big in China. 
_

While talking with friends about the coronavirus outbreak, Baskin, an artist in San Francisco, realized that people using face masks to protect themselves from infection would have trouble unlocking phones that use facial recognition. (This has indeed been a problem.) She quickly created a prototype of a mask printed with a face‚Äînot ‚Äúyour‚Äù face, but rather unique faces of imaginary people generated using artificial intelligence‚Äîand posted her idea on Twitter: ‚ÄúProtect people from viral epidemics while still being able to unlock your phone.‚Äù _

The demand was immediate. Those interested in the idea include cancer patients who want to customize their masks, doctors who work in children‚Äôs hospitals and don‚Äôt want to scare kids‚Äîand people in China. Her invention was picked up by Chinese media, and now her waiting list has over 2,000 people on it, many of them with Chinese email accounts.

The virus that has sickened more than 70,000 people in central China is spreading, setting off outbreaks in South Korea, Iran, and Italy, and now threatens to move around the globe as a true pandemic. The US Centers for Disease Control today said that its spread in the US is inevitable too, although how many people will get the disease is unknown.

In the four short years of its existence, OpenAI has become one of the leading AI research labs in the world. It has made a name for itself producing consistently headline-grabbing research, alongside other AI heavyweights like Alphabet‚Äôs DeepMind. It is also a darling in Silicon Valley, counting Elon Musk and legendary investor Sam Altman among its founders. Above all, it is lionized for its mission. Its goal is to be the first to create AGI‚Äîa machine with the learning and reasoning powers of a human mind. The purpose is not world domination; rather, the lab wants to ensure that the technology is developed safely and its benefits distributed evenly to the world. OpenAI wants to be the shepherd of artificial general intelligence, and it has carefully crafted its image to fit the bill. But three days at OpenAI‚Äôs office‚Äîand nearly three dozen interviews with past and current employees, collaborators, friends, and other experts in the field‚Äîsuggest a different picture.

_

There is a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors. Over time, it has allowed a fierce competitiveness and mounting pressure for ever more funding to erode its founding ideals of transparency, openness, and collaboration. Many who work or worked for the company insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak or feared retaliation. Their accounts suggest that OpenAI, for all its noble aspirations, is obsessed with maintaining secrecy, protecting its image, and retaining the loyalty of its employees.

On Friday morning, Boeing‚Äôs CST-100 Starliner launched into space for the first time, but the uncrewed spacecraft failed to make it into a stable orbit that would allow it to rendezvous with the International Space Station. 
_

After Starliner separated from an Atlas V rocket, it believed it was in a different segment of the mission than it really was. Instead of executing an engine burn to get into its target orbit, Starliner ended up doing a different burn designed to maintain control and precision. The spacecraft burned too much fuel, which will make it too difficult for NASA and Boeing to attempt to dock with the ISS. 
_

Boeing and NASA still have no clue why Starliner‚Äôs timer was off, and that‚Äôs something they‚Äôll be studying intensely over the next several days. Although they cannot test Starliner‚Äôs ability to dock safely with the ISS, they will still be ensuring that the spacecraft is functioning properly during its time in orbit, and determining what mission objectives can still be met with the remaining propellant on board. The plan for now is to return Starliner to Earth Sunday morning, to its original planned landing spot in the White Sands desert in New Mexico.

_

This mission, though uncrewed, would have been a huge milestone for NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program, and an important step toward the resumption of human spaceflight launches from US soil. Any astronauts on board could have taken action to override the automation and get the spacecraft into its proper orbit, says NASA astronaut Nicole Mann, who is slated to fly aboard Starliner for its future crewed test flight. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine echoed those sentiments at a post-launch press conference Friday, telling reporters that had this been a crewed mission, ‚Äúour crew would have been safe.‚Äù Click the link in our bio to learn more.

Imagine the US was just hit with a cyberattack. What happens next?

_

The US has a lot of cyber-enemies. It trades blows with China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea on a daily basis. A full-blown cyberwar, thankfully, remains the stuff of theory and tabletop exercises. But what happens when one breaks out for real?

To better understand how it would play out, we talked to a number of experts in cybersecurity and national security. We asked them to consider hypothetical scenarios, including one in which unknown hackers have accessed the computers, networks, and hardware of gas pipelines in New England.

Kids don't trust Alexa. Two new studies suggest not only that kids are way more sophisticated about voice assistants than we think but also that we, as humans, have an ingrained sense of skepticism about unknown sources that somehow gets fuzzier as we grow older. The onslaught of fake news and the rampant disinformation campaigns now common on social media might make it seem as if we dumb humans don‚Äôt investigate sources as deeply as we should. These studies indicate otherwise: technology isn‚Äôt something we trust naturally, at least when we‚Äôre young.

_ ‚ÄúKids are paying attention,‚Äù says Judith Danovitch, a researcher at the University of Louisville and an author of one of the studies. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre keeping track of who knows what they‚Äôre talking about and who doesn‚Äôt. Kids don‚Äôt just blindly believe every answer they get. And we look at the internet or computer programs; they don‚Äôt blindly believe those either.‚Äù _

Earlier this year, a source sent us a copy of an unpublished manuscript describing the creation of the first gene-edited babies, born last year in China. We are making excerpts of that manuscript public for the first time in this report by Antonio Regalado. Titled ‚ÄúBirth of Twins After Genome Editing for HIV Resistance,‚Äù and 4,699 words long, the still unpublished paper was authored by He Jiankui, the Chinese biophysicist who created the edited twin girls. A second manuscript we also received discusses laboratory research on human and animal embryos. We shared the unpublished manuscripts with four experts‚Äîa legal scholar, an IVF doctor, an embryologist, and a gene-editing specialist‚Äîand asked them for their reactions.

The rock era and the space age exist on parallel time lines. Mankind‚Äôs assault upon the heavens was the most dramatic achievement of the 20th century‚Äôs second half, simultaneous with rock‚Äôs transformation of youth culture. It does not take a deconstructionist to see the influence of the former on the latter. The number of pop lyrics fixated on the concept of space is massive, and perhaps even predictable. It was the language of the era. But what‚Äôs more complicated is what that concept came to signify, particularly in terms of how the silence of space was somehow supposed to sound.

A few times a month, Bassam pushes a shopping cart through the aisles of a grocery store stocked with bags of rice, a small selection of fresh vegetables, and other staples. At the checkout counter, a cashier tallies the total, but Bassam doesn‚Äôt pay with cash or a credit card. Instead he lifts his head to a black box and gazes into the mirror and camera at its center. A moment later, an image of Bassam‚Äôs eye flashes on the cashier‚Äôs screen. Bassam collects his receipt‚Äîwhich reads ‚ÄúEyePay‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorld Food Programme Building Blocks‚Äù across the top‚Äîand walks out into the noonday chaos of the Zaatari refugee camp.

In Halaguru, a small town south of Bangalore, a blacksmith named Sidhappa Ji hammers glowing orange beams into sharp-edged sickles, in a hot metal shed 10 steps from an electricity pole. But because he doesn‚Äôt have legal documents for the property, he can‚Äôt obtain electricity, a problem shared by many in India‚Äôs slums. That's where Selco, a Bangalore-based social enterprise, comes in. 
_

Selco has been supplying solar panels, batteries, and other tools to homes, farms, and businesses in rural villages. Through its foundation, the organization develops customized solar-powered tools for micro-entrepreneurs, including the blower that Ji uses to stoke his fire. The nonprofit has also created water pumps, photocopiers, and cattle-milking contraptions that run directly off solar panels and batteries, and it‚Äôs working on chili-powder pounders, banana-chip choppers, and puffed-rice puffers.

_

Given India's sprawling scale and fragmented grids, decentralized renewable power will need to play a large role in electrification, says Pratim Raha, a program manager at the Selco Foundation. That, in turn, will also ensure that clean energy sources can account for as much as possible of the projected rise in energy consumption in the decades to come.

_ ‚ÄúIf your narrative is ‚ÄòThe grid will come and solve all problems,‚Äô that‚Äôs not right in India,‚Äù Raha says.

Since the spring of 2018, Mexico‚Äôs Caribbean coast and the shorelines of 19 other countries in the region have been inundated with unprecedented amounts of Sargassum seaweed. Tourists expecting pristine white beaches have instead been confronted with endless piles of slimy, decaying vegetation. While it‚Äôs normal for the brown macroalgae to appear on Caribbean shorelines in smaller amounts, outlier blooms have been increasing in size and regularity over the past 10 years. The one that occurred last year is believed to be the worst ever in the region. Now efforts are mounting not just to contain the ecological crisis but to capitalize on it.

No, not the Apollo 11 crew, but the crew of Apollo 9, Russell Schweickart, David Scott, and James McDivitt. These three men unveiled the lander to the press that they would test out and live in for 10 days in space, before the Apollo 11 crew would later take it to the moon. As Colonel McDivitt told the @nytimes, ‚ÄúThe purpose of the flight is to see if this whole gigantic mess would be able to fly to the moon and land there.‚Äù The mission launched a few months later on March 3, 1969.

In mid-January 1969, eyes were already on Apollo 11 even though Apollo 9 had yet to launch. On January 9, 1969, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, and Neil Armstrong were announced as the crew of the mission. However, as they told @nytimes at the time, they still didn‚Äôt know which one would step on the moon first. (About a third of the article was also focused on the astronaut‚Äôs wives‚Äô reactions to the news.) Before the announcement, the three had already trained as a backup crew for the Apollo 8 mission that orbited the moon successfully the month prior.

Quantum computers pose a security threat that we‚Äôre still totally unprepared for. That's the message of a new report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. These experts think it could take at least 20 years to get quantum-proof encryption widely deployed. If hackers get their hands on powerful quantum machines before then, the result could be a security and privacy nightmare.
